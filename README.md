## Quickstart with Dapp development

### Setup and build the frontend

First, make sure the environment variables are set for `./frontend`.
Take a look at `./frontend/.env.local.example` for the complete list.

- You can either set these yourself (e.g. in CI/CD)
- or copy the file to `.env.local` and populate it.

Then the do a turbo build of all apps, run the following:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

The resulting static site can be found in `./build/`.

### Running the prod server

If you've already run the build, you can use `yarn serve:build` to serve the built files

### Running the frontend dev server

To run a dev server that watches for changes across code and Plasmic, run:

```bash
yarn dev:frontend
```

## E2E Local Development

We now have a mostly localized development infrastructure that can be used when
developing the Dapp. The localized development infrastructure will spin up a
localchain, graph, and postgres. Your local machine must
have docker and docker compose installed.

### Setup environment variables

You will then need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the repository with at the following environment variables:

```
# Required
PLASMIC_PROJECT_ID=
PLASMIC_PROJECT_API_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID=

# Optional (used to fund an address on the localchain)
LOCAL_TESTING_ADDRESS=
```

### Starting the local development infrastructure

Once you have your environment configured you can run the infrastructure like so:

```
yarn dev:serve-e2e
```

Once everything is the dapp will be served from http://127.0.0.1:3000. You will
need to point your metamask to the localchain at 127.0.0.1:8545 with ChainID 31337.

## Playbooks

For setup and common operations for each subproject, navigate into the respective directory and check out the `README.md`.

We also maintain a [playbook](https://hypercerts.org/docs/devops) for larger operations.
