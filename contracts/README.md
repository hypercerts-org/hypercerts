## Contracts

### IHypercertToken

This interface is the requirements set for hypercert compliant tokens. This enables developer to use their own prefered
token implementation or standard.

### HypercertMinter

Example implementation for a hypercert token that is an `ERC1155 NFT` under the hood with an `Allowlist` extension.

#### Goerli

HypercertMinter (UUPS Proxy) is deployed to proxy address:
[0x94a04Ce2e537eaf2Bdabd629dE503797e7021E87](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x94a04Ce2e537eaf2Bdabd629dE503797e7021E87#code)
