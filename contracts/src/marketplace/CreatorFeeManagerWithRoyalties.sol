     * @dev There are two on-chain sources for the royalty fee to distribute.
     *      1. RoyaltyFeeRegistry: It is an on-chain registry where creator fee is defined
     *         for all items of a collection.
     *      2. ERC2981: The NFT Royalty Standard where royalty fee is defined at a itemId level in a collection.
     *      The on-chain logic looks up the registry first. If it does not find anything,
     *      it checks if a collection is ERC2981. If so, it fetches the proper royalty information for the itemId.
     *      For a bundle that contains multiple itemIds (for a collection using ERC2981), if the royalty fee/recipient
     *      differ among the itemIds part of the bundle, the trade reverts.
     *      This contract DOES NOT enforce any restriction for extremely high creator fee,
     *      nor verifies the creator fee fetched is inferior to the total price.
     *      If any contract relies on it to build an on-chain royalty logic,
     *      it should implement protection against:
     *      (1) high royalties
     *      (2) potential unexpected royalty changes that can occur after the creation of the order.
