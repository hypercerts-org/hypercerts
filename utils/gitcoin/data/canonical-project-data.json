    "projectDescription": "Verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum make it possible to have a unique, anonymous identity. Developing this cryptographic primitive into wallets will unlock sybil-resistant anonymous apps like zk nullifiers for anonymous unlinked airdrops, anonymous decentralized voting which only allows one vote per account, and message boards with a consistent identity. We think that fully executing this work will create a whole new class of dapps and web3 social apps with pseudonymity.\n\n\n\nThis grant will go to helping to integrate a new, non-interactive signature scheme into wallets such as Metamask, filing an EIP, and engineering the zero knowledge cryptography behind it. Note that this scheme offers an improvement to semaphore or tornado cash nullifiers, because the first few people who sign up will not have small anonymity sets. The grant will also help to publish the paper that proves the security of the scheme via a DDH-VRF argument, and pay for conference expenses so it can be presented more widely. It will be split amongst Kobi, Aayush, Richard, Piotr, and anyone else who would like to help productionize this work!\n\n\n\nWe will likely call the final version your plume -- a privately linked unique message entity. In other words, we will deploy verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to read the paper, it can be found at https://aayushg.com/thesis.pdf. The slides to fully explain the new scheme are found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mKtOI4XgKrWBEPpKFAYkRjxZsBomwhy6Cc2Ia87hAnY, and the code is here: https://github.com/zk-nullifier-sig/zk-nullifier-sig. The academic paper is here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1255. A blog post is here: https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/nullifier. DM @yush_g on Twitter with questions or in the Personae Discord! Initial research was funded by a $4k grant from 0xPARC and done as part of an MIT masters thesis.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Your money has gone to good use! Due to your generosity, we were able to push forward a lot of progress, including that we were able to develop a Metamask snap (deployed at nullifier.xyz) and push an independent Javascript implementation that discovered an overflow bug in both of the Rust implementations! We also are building towards a burner wallet integration and EIP, both of which we are actively polishing drafts on. This project is now being developed to power future anonymity tech at Personae Labs.",

    "projectDescription": "\ud83c\udf44 THE PROBLEM  \n\nSetting up an Ethereum Node is technically demanding and needs a lot of research & preparation to do. Being confronted with this challenge a lot of nontechnical people therefore, even if they are in the position of owning 32 ETH, are choosing to use a staking service to not risk their funds, which in turn slowly centralises the network. \n\n\ud83c\udf44 OUR SOLUTION \n\nStereum is our answer to this problem, a toolkit to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum/Gnosis Node using an intuitive GUI to abstract the installation process down to a few clicks, lessening the technical entry barrier for the average person. \n\nTo use Stereum, you download the launcher & connect remotely to your fresh Ubuntu server.  \n\nIn three clicks, Stereum configures all necessary prerequisites your server has to meet, installs and runs Ethereum client software, and ensures that your node is properly connected and synced with the network.  \n\nBy setting up your own node  with Stereum you are able to participate in Solo Staking in your preferred network and validate transactions and blocks. The node also serves as your gateway to the network for data science, dApp usage and development.  \n\nWith Stereum you also have the opportunity to run different node related protocols (like SSV, etc.) & profit off of there unique architecture.  \n\nStereum, our Ethereum Node Installation, Setup & Management tool aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your node for ETH staking, data science dApp hosting & development.  \n\nWe hope to explore every hermit\u2019s dream with you! \n\n\ud83c\udf44 USE OF FUNDS \n\nYour contribution is greatly appreciated by the team and will be used in various ways \u2013 development, testing and security audits. We spend the funds generated through grants and donations purely on tasks, that will benefit the progress of the project and therefore the decentralisation of Ethereum as well as protocols on it.  \n\n\ud83c\udf44 FURTHER LINKS\n\n\t\ud83c\udf44 Project Website - https://stereum.net/\n\n\t\ud83d\udd28 GitHub - https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum-node\n\n\t\ud83d\udcac Discord - https://discord.gg/DzAwgnSXtB\n\n\t\ud83d\udcf0 Twitter - https://twitter.com/stereumdev\n\n\t\ud83d\udcfa YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/@Stereum\n\n",

    "projectDescription": "\nPROBLEM\n\nEtherscan provides a great block explorer for web3, much like Alphabet provides a great search engine for web2 and Microsoft provides a great OS for businesses. However, core Ethereum values run counter to a closed-source, single-solution ideology for a decentralized blockchain network. Open-source alternatives are absolutely required to augment, improve, and democratize the block explorer experience. \n\nEthereum-based blockchains and L2s need better open-source explorer options to support: \n-Checks and balances (is the data accurate?)\n-Redundancy and resiliency (what if Etherscan is down?)\n-Community-driven features and innovation (I want to improve and customize that explorer!)\n-Transparency (How does it work?)\n-Quick, cost-effective implementation (I don\u2019t have much capital but I need to spin up an explorer yesterday!)\n-Trustlessness (I trust the code, not any single entity in charge of all data presentation.)\n\nSOLUTION\n\nBlockscout has been in production for nearly 5 years. We provide an open-source explorer used by more than 100 chains in the space, including public goods support for an Ethereum mainnet instance. \n\nBlockscout has been used by small chains, big chains, private chains, test chains, L2 chains and many others to quickly spin up an instance and provide transactional transparency right away for their users...AND we know that Blockscout needs to be improved to compete with and provide a viable alternative to closed-source explorers.\n\nHOW FUNDING WILL BE USED\n\nWe\u2019ve started working on a major overhaul called Blockscout 2.0. It aims to provide all the views, functionality and UX you expect from a premium block explorer. In addition, new features including Rollup support, an optimized API layer, DApp marketplace, and a new microservices infrastructure written in Rust are all in active development. More on the 2.0 roadmap -> https://docs.blockscout.com/about/roadmap/blockscout-2.0\n\nBlockscout 2.0 is currently being built, and with your help we can bring it to the community much faster, with many more features, and with much greater impact. We are particularly excited about the new React UI for users and Rust microservices for developers. With this new architecture in place, our team as well as the greater developer community will be able to easily customize functionality without compromising performance.\n\nWe will also devote grant funding resources to improving rollup support. Rollup usage is growing every day, and we need to provide comprehensive views to support this ever-expanding world of layer 2 data. \n\nAs we continue to decentralize the future, the tools and infrastructure supporting decentralization must also follow this pattern. We appreciate your funding to support a transparent, open-source, premium block explorer! ",

Funds raised through this grant will be used to pay people to coordinate and navigate community to better educational resources, educate community, encourage people to work and build in open source, support Ethereum Core development.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Magicians is a Community of Individuals collaborating on improving the Ethereum Protocol. FEM (Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians) forum provides a high signal noise free space for discussing any Ethereum Protocol Improvements, supporting the community in protocol decision making, and providing space for high quality discussions.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Magicians community is focused mainly around Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). We provide a key communication channel (forum) for core developers and the community to discuss anything EIP or Ethereum Improvements and Protocol related. \n\nWe are hanging out on https://ethereum-magicians.org/ forum and sometimes in person at bigger events. \n\n\n\nThe ongoing benefit that we bring to the community is that our work empowers decision-makers to gather feedback and move the tech forward, and encourages developers and researchers to collaborate closely via the Magicians' Forum. This helps make Ethereum the best technology that it can be!\n\n\n\nFunds received will be managed by members of the Operations Ring, a group which manages resources for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, organises events, and maintains the Forum. Your donation will be used to organise upcoming events and discussions, operate and pay for maintaining and moderating the FEM forum and expenses related to these activities.\n\n \n\nAll contributions to our grant highly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f",

The idea of a ReFi Commons is new, and we are super excited to share it with you! \n\nBut first, an update.\n\nGR15 UPDATE\n\nAs a result of the $69,040 we received from the Gitcoin community in GR15, over the last three months we were able to achieve many key milestones:\n\n- Support 152 founders in FC02\n- Onboard over 70 community managers into the CM Guild\n- Onboard over 20 regen investors \n- Reach 1700 newsletter subscribers\n- Co-launch the $1M grant pool with Future Quest, Celo, Polygon, and others\n\nREFI PASSPORT & KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\n\nAfter consulting with the Gitcoin Passport team, we decided to delay ReFi Passport due to the rate of change for the Gitcoin Passport codebase in Q4 2022. \n\nWe\u2019ve been iterating a prototype of the knowledge graph around MRV (\u2018Measurement, Reporting & Verification\u2019) with an alpha version in the works. \n\nWe\u2019ve expanded our directory to include people, content, deals and events\u2014all of this aimed at helping onboard more talent and capital into the work of regeneration.\n\nTHEORY OF CHANGE\n\nWe believe that in order to realize a global regenerative economy, we need to fulfill three objectives:\n\n1. A global startup movement rooted in diverse local communities\n2. Hundreds of radical startup experiments drive exponential impact\n3. Global coordination between private, public and civil society organizations\n\nREFI COMMONS INCUBATOR\n\nTo test this evolved theory of change, we are raising money to launch a 6-month ReFi Commons Incubator with Commons Stack to accelerate the growth of local startup communities that fulfill three objectives:\n\n1. Onboard new talent and capital into ReFi\n2. Create radical startup experiments for exponential impact\n3. Build public, private and civil society partnerships\n\nThe goal is to pilot the incubator with an initial cohort of three communities and to build a regular program that incubates ReFi Commons all over the world.\n\nWHAT IS A REFI COMMONS?\n\nA ReFi Commons is a founder-led impact DAO that exists to regenerate the earth through radical startup experimentation and innovation. \n\nA ReFi Commons could be created as a startup community in a specific city (Lisbon, Bangalore) or a startup ecosystem focused on a shared problem space (such as plastic pollution or biodiversity).  \n\nThe models and methods of regeneration are unique to each community, but there are a few key criteria:\n\n1. Mission, vision, and values statements establish the commons\n2. All funds must be held in a public treasury \n3. Community curates governance parameters and procedures\n4. Impact activities must be publicly verifiable\n5. Funded startup ventures must be open source\n6. Impact and finances are reported quarterly\n7. Three or more founding members make a 7-year commitment to realize their mission and vision of regeneration while upholding the commons\u2019 values\n\nThe idea for a ReFi Commons takes inspiration from Eleanor Ostrom\u2019s 8 Principles, Charles Eisenstein\u2019s Sacred Economics and Brad Feld\u2019s Startup Community Way. \n\nIt is rooted in the belief that governments and corporations cannot solve climate change alone. \n\nWe need a social movement that creates new economic models and provides an alternative to our extractive system.\n\nWHAT DOES A REFI COMMONS DO?\n\nWhile we recognize that regeneration looks differently according to the context, we believe there are a number of key behaviors that contribute to the three core objectives of a ReFi Commons. \n\nThe key behaviors are:\n\n1. Hold regular meetings and events\n2. Create shared work spaces\n3. Collaborate with other startup communities\n4. Build in public\n5. Support entrepreneurs and innovators\n\nTHE REFI COMMONS PRIZE \n\nThe ReFi Commons Prize will be the genesis cohort of the ReFi Commons Incubator focused entirely on starting ReFi Commons in strategic local communities. \n\nIt\u2019s an opportunity for regens all around the world to submit proposals to become a ReFi Commons with the full support of ReFiDAO and Commons Stack with a strong core contributor team:\n\n- Griff Green\n- Tamara \n- Liviade\n- Usama\n- Daryl Edwards\n- John Ellison\n\nThe genesis cohort will award prizes to three local ReFi Commons to implement an adapted Commons Stack framework in a strategic physical community over six months culminating in the launch of a governance token via an augmented bonding curve or other market mechanism. \n\nThe first three Commons will be selected by a community-led governance process with details to follow.\n\nThe expectation is for each ReFi Commons to participate in the global ReFiDAO community and to provide a critical onramp of talent and capital to accelerate impact for people and the planet.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nWe are looking to raise $100k to cover operating expenditure for the ReFi Commons Prize for three months. This is half of the program, but there are some fixed up-front costs that reduces the overal expenditure. We need at least $75k to launch the program.\n\nAll funds raised will go towards the ReFi Commons Prize.\n\nBEAR MARKET GRATITUDE\n \nWe have been so grateful to everyone in the Gitcoin community for their incredible support over the last 12 months. \n\nWe will continue to steward the funds received with maximum capital efficiency, respecting the conditions of the market and the long-term horizon of the challenges at hand.\n\nWe are not building this startup movement for this cycle, or for next, but to see a global regenerative economy\u2014and beyond.\n\nREGENERATION FOR ALL \n\nGiven that the vast majority of climate projects are rooted in the global south, we commit to a balanced representation of founders and communities supported through the ReFi Commons Incubator.\n\nThe vision of regeneration requires radical inclusion\u2014especially for traditionally marginalized groups. We appreciate the Gitcoin community supporting us in this effort and are super excited to bring it to life!",

    "projectDescription": "TLDR -  Let\u2019s make ReFi accessible for all! Gitcoin support will enable support for IRL events establishing places of belonging for the ReFi Movement.\n \n       Our Why?\n \nImagine a regenerative economy, a financial system that serves humanity and our collective home - Earth.\nWithin web3, the ReFi movement aims to cultivate this vision within a new economic system. ReFi Spring exists to support its emergence across a rich diversity of global networks by facilitating strong bonds between individuals through human IRL interaction. \n \nWhat does ReFi Spring do?\n \nReFi Spring is a nonprofit working to enable global IRL ReFi events to create new communities in the ReFi ecosystem. We do this by providing free, accessible, full-range event support services and educational content, including: \n \nHow we do it\n \nEvent Toolkit: This toolkit contains all the information event organisers need to run a successful ReFi event, including event frameworks, marketing materials, tips for press engagement, workshop plans, and more.\n \nEvent Funding: Every ReFi event can apply for event funding; however, our funding criteria is weighted towards supporting events by and for marginalised communities. We recognise the importance of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion as fundamental values supporting the healthy growth of the ReFi ecosystem. \n \nEvent Organizer Cohort: Providing upskilling sessions and the networking environment to grow the community of ReFi on-the-ground leaders.\n \nIntro to ReFi Course: ReFi Spring is currently curating an \u201cIntro to ReFi\u201d online learning course for new and native audiences to understand and engage in the ReFi ecosystem. \n\nReFi Rabbithole: Supporting the creation set of interconnected materials that explain what ReFi is to new audiences\n \nWe offer all of the above and so much more as a public good to the ReFi Community.\n \nGR15 Update\n \nThanks to GR15 support, we enabled a further five events for a total of 27 events for Season 1 of ReFi Spring \n \nReFi COP16 was series of talks, workshops, and panels addressing the use blockchain to increase the efficiency of the global fight against the climate emergency led by Regen Network at COP16.\n\nReFi Mercadito Verde - A ReFi Spring event focused on social currencies which promote a circular economy and a network of exchanges in Monteverde, Costa Rica.\n\nReFi India - A hugely successful first ReFi event in Bangalore, with over 100 participants and 15+ speakers.\n\nReFi Primavera Regenerativa - In Minas Gerais, Brazil, this event kicked off a season of meet-ups between web3 natives and agroforestry practitioners.\n\nDescentraliza BH - The first Bankless Brazil IRL event introducing newbies to Web3 and Web3 natives to the ReFi movement, this was the first event to address ReFi in the city of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\n\n \nAlpha Round Goals\n\nGoals for Alpha Round\n \n$5000 can fund 2 events + support our ongoing operational costs and the development of further open-source event materials\n$10000 can support 4 more events in 2022 + \u201c \u201d\n$20000 can support 8 more events in 2022 +  \u201c \u201c\n$50000 can support 20 more events in 2023 + \u201c \u201c\n\n\nIn recognition of the exclusive nature of the Alpha round and our strong desire to continue to see the growth of the ReFi movement, ReFi Spring will drip 25% of the total of donations to gitcoin projects that support underserved communities and that are actively supporting Regenerative projects and education. \n \n \n\n \nThank you for your support and for being part of this movement! There\u2019s never been a more vital need to regenerate the Earth.\n",

    "projectDescription": " \n\ud83c\udf0d Bloom is a cyber-physical social network that helps people find and participate in grassroots climate actions where they live. https://bloomnetwork.earth\n\nToday, we are 30,000 people on the ground in 22 local Bloom hubs across 9 countries doing rapid climate repair and adaptation.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Problem\n\n67% of people feel there is a climate emergency, but they don't know what they can do about it. Meanwhile, there are plenty of solutions happening on the ground, but they lack media visibility and funding, so they remain underground.\n\n\ud83c\udf3b Solution\n\nLocal Bloom hubs connect existing projects in their region. They plant community gardens, teach people to form agroforestry co-ops, and build regional token economies focused on land and water stewardship. Online, we share knowledge P2P as a global community to implement climate repair more quickly and cost-effectively.\n\nHere is a video produced by Diamante Bridge Collective, a local Bloom hub in Costa Rica. It tells the story of what's happening on the ground and how we use web3 to bridge the finance gap to local-led regeneration.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f https://youtu.be/ENPt3lednAM\n\nBloom's social network is a vibrant hub for people to see the beautiful work happening around the planet, to flip mainstream narratives from fear to constructive, empowered action of caring for one another.\n\n\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38 Our goal for 2023: Welcome 100 new local Bloom hubs. \ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf38\n\nWhat will we buidl with funds from this round?\n\nComplete the social interactivity on Bloom Platform : Connect Unlock member NFT to our sign-in system : Pilot our local/international member fee splits to jumpstart local Blooms : Complete our cooperative/DAO formation with the help of an all-women legal team. This will reduce risk for our longstanding communities as we teach them to use cryptocurrency.\n\nSince GR15:\n\nWe released the MVP of our multi-user blogging platform: regenerative action templates, action reporting (MRV), blogs, profiles, and automated local Bloom media feed pages. Lastly, our platform crew became an all-female team! \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffd\n\n\ud83c\udfac Why Now\n\nLocal grassroots climate projects and Indigenous leaders have deep local ecosystem knowledge for how to repair soil, prevent deforestation, and reduce flooding risk. They are the key to accelerating climate action globally.\n\nWhy us \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\n\nLocal Bloom organizers are master community builders, local food system stewards, and healers. Our tech team works with major television networks and dOrg.tech building DAO tooling. Lastly, our media team, based in Mumbai India, are creating the most wonderful graphics and communications from their experience as journalists and creatives!

    "projectDescription": "\"What you seek is seeking you.\" - Rumi\n\n         ---------         \n\nThe systems and institutions that got us into this mess will not get us out. The climate and biodiversity crises will be solved from the bottom up:  by People like you, Place by Place by Place, on Purpose.\n\nTLDR\n\n.basin is perpetual place-based climate and nature finance.\n\n.basin scales land, ecosystem, and carbon sink restoration and conservation to solve the climate, nature, and carbon crises.\n\n\"RISK\"\n\nThe crises we face are interconnected and not isolated from one another.  \n\nLand-use change caused by development pressure has resulted in a decline of 69% in species populations since 1970. One million species, or 1 in 7, are now threatened with extinction, with another 40% in decline.  Simultaneously, if we fail to limit temperature increases, climate change will exacerbate biodiversity loss.\n\nThe climate and biodiversity crises have two main things in common: risk and land use.  Whether it be wildfires, flooding, heat, drought, habitat loss, income inequality, carbon sequestration, pollination, desertification, deforestation, etc, etc all pose serious risks to individuals, businesses, investors, and governments AND all interact with land in one way or another.\n\nHistorically, risk is not directly investable.  But land, and real estate, are.\n\nINVESTABLE\n\n.basin makes climate risk and nature loss risk investable through the use of tried and true real estate investment fundamentals to attract agnostic and indifferent capital into climate solutions, climate resilience, and climate adaptation.  \n\nThe .basin model combines law, technology, and finance to make climate and nature investable not only for institutional and private capital but also philanthropy.\n\nCLIMATE & NATURE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT\n\nClimate will be solved not only place by place by place but project by project by project.  The .basin protocol scales individual climate, carbon, and nature projects through shared upside and reduced risk.  \n\nThe .basin model of course works for forest projects but we take it several steps further to make projects that have enormous ecosystem service benefits (in addition to carbon) like wetlands, floodplains, peatlands, urban heat islands, estuaries, algae, biocrust, etc investable.  The .basin model also works for embodied carbon in buildings, the plugging of methane/gas leaks, and keeping oil and gas permanently in the ground.\n\nRESTORATION & CONSERVATION\n\nWhile the .basin model works for any property, regardless of size or location, the focus is on carbon sink and ecosystem restoration and conservation for maximum climate impact.\n\nINDIVIDUAL & COLLECTIVE\n\nThe .basin model is designed to allow individuals to prosper while the collective flourishes. The flow of $STREAMS through $BASINS is a circular value exchange whereby collective success is only possible if individuals are successful and vice versa. All .basin's can be solely, jointly, or collectively managed.\n\nSPEED & SCALE\n\nThe organizational and operational model of .basin is deployable, repeatable, and scalable for any place on earth and any type of ecosystem.  As a series of interrelated but independent entities .basin is built for both the challenges of today and the promise of tomorrow.  Our main entities are trust.basin, foundation.basin, dao.basin and a series of llc.basin's.\n\nPLACE, PURPOSE & PEOPLE\n\nClimate and nature can be (over)simplified to Place, Purpose, and People.  Each .basin represents a place, purpose, or person/people but each is deeply connected to the others.\n\nPLACE:  as indicated by the name, .basin is primarily organized by watershed or basin.  This is similar to how humans have organized for thousands of years before we labeled nations and states. But .basin's can also be an ecosystem, your town, a place you visited, a place you care about.  We have even minted .basin's for individual trees.  Any point on the globe can be a .basin.  Examples: hudson.basin, indus.basin, flintriver.basin, congo.basin.\n\nPURPOSE:  Just as we share common-place, we share common interests and common purpose.  This could be a cause you care about, a movement, a hobby or even a sport.  Most purpose .basin's are climate, nature and biodiversity focused. Examples: baldeagle.basin, beaver.basin, greensalamander.basin, wetlands.basin, carbon.basin, nature.basin.\n\nPEOPLE: people are the connection points to place and purpose.  People are individuals, groups, organizations, companies, and even governments. Examples: tmo.basin, joebrewer.basin, will.basin, finley.basin, mckenna.basin\n\nUNDER THE HOOD\n\nAll .basins are ERC-721 NFT\u2019s energized with Charged Particles (@defiNFT).  All .basin's can store and hold any number and combination of ERC-20\u2019s or NFT\u2019s inside.  Many ERC-20's are yield bearing via Aave inside each .basin and can have time locks.\n\n.basin's are a store of and fund what is truly valuable.  As perpetual purpose trusts and permanent endowments for natural capital and ecological assets .basin's hold financial value but also clean air, clean water, biodiversity, pollination, human health, and safety or any tokenized impact certificate.  The more value a .basin holds the more $STREAMS it receives.\n\nCONTRACTS\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/basin\n\n$BASIN: https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4bf5a99ea2f8de061f7d77ba9edd749503d945da\n\nCharged Particles: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0288280df6221e7e9f23c1bb398c820ae0aa6c10\n\n$CRK (CREEKS): https://polygonscan.com/token/0xf122a63f9fd807fa28a3495ad822ad84c934793d\n\n$STREAMS\n\n$STREAMS are the flows of value through the .basin ecosystem.  Technically they will be either a fungible ERC-20 or a semi-fungible ERC-1155.  $STREAMS are designed to incentivize positive outcomes and eliminate negative externalities.  $STREAMS are governance, access, and utility but also a flow of absolute value from trust.basin distributions. \n\nPREVIOUS GRANT ROUNDS\n\nGitcoin has moved our work forward over the last 14 months.

    "projectDescription": "About\nThe Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.\n\nIntroduction\nThe town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000 hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.\n\nWhat Has Been Accomplished \nWe successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15) and have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work. This included hosting the #ReFiBarichara event in the first week of October that gathered like-minded people from the web3, crypto, and regenerative spaces.\n\nProjects we are supporting include:\n1.\t The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.\n2.\tA community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that promotes the organic emergence of solidarity food exchanges while supporting local artists and craftspeople.\n3.\tA community reforestation project called Bioparque M\u00f3ncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.\n4.\tThe construction of a community theater called Canay Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts \u2013 all in service to regeneration of the territory.\n5.\tThe Barichara Ecoversity that is weaving educational activities throughout the region with a special focus on watershed restoration, preservation of native ecology, and how to create regenerative economies at the bioregional scale.\n\nWith funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving a tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through Barichara Updates and learning journeys.\n\nLand and the Ecoversity\nThe BRF works to restore ecological health through a multifaceted strategy of weaving together current regenerative projects in Barichara, purchasing land for regenerative work, and creating groups and organizations to facilitate this work. Already, the BRF has raised $50,000 to purchase a heavily degraded plot of land, Origen del Agua, and has begun regenerative work on it.\n\nRecently, the BRF has secured a second piece of land, Las Albercas, that will be the future home of the central campus of the Barichara Ecoversity. Here an off-grid campus will be created to provide on-the-ground training in various regenerative techniques such as permaculture, rainwater harvesting, renewable energy solutions, and syntropic agroforestry. The Barichara Ecoversity will serve as an integrating hub for both research and education in the territory with the Las Albercas campus serving as a place for experts and students to gather to teach and learn the skills needed for restoring planetary health, all while cultivating a deep connection to the land.\n\nSyntropic Agroforestry\nOne of the central projects of the BRF has been spreading syntropic agroforestry throughout the territory. Syntropic agroforestry aims to foster climax ecosystems independent from outside inputs with an emphasis on plants geared towards maintaining food for human consumption. This works through the planting of food crops next to support species that aid with water retention, the fixing of nitrogen in the soils, the creation of shade, and the production of biomass to continually provide organic matter to cover the soil and enrich it over time. These methods encourage a process of ecological succession to occur as would happen in a natural process of forest expansion, just much faster and focused on supporting edible species. The process is one of syntropy with increased growth, diversity, density, and complexity throughout the entire system compared to conventional or organic agriculture.\n\nThe BRF has supported the creation of syntropic agroforestry projects throughout the territory. A syntropic agroforestry expert was brought to Barichara and has been teaching local farmers within the region. Specifically, two three-day design classes on syntropic agroforestry have been offered, giving participants a technical explanation of the principles of the technique and then hands-on instruction through the creation of two field sites. The demand for syntropic agroforestry has been great in the territory, and our aim is to continue supporting those wanting to learn on their journey towards transitioning to regenerative food production.\n\nOther Work\nThe work of the BRF is constantly evolving in relation to what is emerging on the ground in Barichara.\n\nA community council was set up to coordinate regenerative action in the territory with funds from the BRF being used to support fifteen local projects in the community, greatly facilitating the development of relationships among these projects in the territory.\nAs its successor, we are in the process of creating a Territorial Foundation to formally facilitate the reception of funds and mediate their use in a process ensuring consent and support from the local community.\n\nAll these efforts combine to form a cohesive and self-reinforcing Bioregional Investment Platform where the individuals and organizations dedicated to regeneration cyclically flow value amongst each other, creating a consistent spinning out of social and ecological value for the entire territory. With your help, the BRF aims to support this ever-evolving process of territorial regeneration.\n\nNext steps for the BRF\nThe work of the BRF has been ongoing for nearly three years, and much has been accomplished in that time. The relationships developed through this work and the land that has been acquired has given the BRF the foundation on which to pivot to long-term strategic planning to ensure the holistic restoration of the entire territory. One of our partners and collaborators, Commonland Foundation, has created a landscape investment framework currently utilized by fifteen territories around the world.\n\nTheir model is a five-step, twenty-year process to produce a self-sustaining regenerative economy, geared towards social and ecological improvement. Key to the success of this model is the formation of a core team with enough funds to dedicate themselves completely to this work all throughout the twenty-year period. This initial investment in a core team provides the supports necessary to ensure that the work reaches maturity, and a regenerative economy can form and begin to sustain the entire territory. This core team is currently in development and will continue the work of the ongoing regenerative projects in the area.\n\nThe development and funding of this core team forms one of three major funding efforts for the BRF. The second is the funding and construction of the Ecoversity, described above, and the third, the support of the current regenerative projects in the area. These three overarching projects will allow us to move towards holistic landscape regeneration at a bioregional scale. In total, this amounts to raising $500,000 in the next year to accelerate this work. The funds gathered through the Gitcoin grant round will be directed towards this purpose.\n\nBioregional Activators\nWe created a new community platform called Bioregional Activators to create a planetary network of regenerative economies \u2013 sharing what we learn from projects in Barichara to help other landscapes around the world. \n\nThis includes activating four bioregions in the Central Rockies that are all located in Colorado; an upcoming trip to Toronto and the Finger Lakes of New York to help form alliances among bioregions in the Great Lakes Region, and growing interest to have us work with landscapes in British Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\n\nVision\nAll the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.\n\nLearn More\nBRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others\u2019 experiences. He and others from Barichara regularly provide updates on their progress in videos and articles on the network. \n\nTo learn more about regenerative work in Barichara visit: https://www.regeneratebarichara.org\n\nTo learn more about Earth Regenerators visit: \nhttps://earth-regenerators.mn.co/\n\nTo learn more about the planetary network of Bioregional Activators visit: \nhttps://bioregional-activators.mn.co/",

Out of this have grown ongoing conversations with the Earth Regenerators and other partners about utilizing the Commons Credit as a funding and accounting mechanism for their bio-regional regeneration efforts\n\n- Initiated conversations with communities in Colorado around the formation of a Bioregional Node that will act as the flagship and real-world laboratory for ReCommon\u2019s innovative community land tenure systems.\n\n- Integrated our learnings from 2022 to prepare for a big 2023, including initiating a land-based project in the American West. \ud83c\udfd4\n\n\n\u2728 OVERVIEW \u2728\n\nAt ReCommon, our mission is to facilitate the reclamation and stewardship of common land by supporting the emergence of resilient place-based communities and regenerative economies. To achieve this, we leverage regenerative financial infrastructure and innovative governance frameworks to secure communally stewarded lands for both current and future generations to thrive on.\n\nReCommon draws inspiration from three foundational pillars: the Community Land Trust model of land tenure, ecological design, and distributed technologies. When woven together, these three pillars of thought pose a viable alternative to the current extractive paradigm of land use and ownership that is destroying the ecological systems we need to survive and thrive here on planet Earth.\n\nThis particular model of land tenure is both new and old, a mix of time-honored principles and modern wisdom. Our organization is a catalyst for both global and local communities to rise to the unique challenges of our times and emerge into a new era of abundance and connectedness.\n\n\"The story of land is older than the story of man. Land came first; no man created it. Every society, large or small, must devise ways in which its members will share this gift. This is allocation. Members of the society must also determine under what conditions the land will be passed on to the next generation. This is continuity. And they must decide if, when, and how it may be traded with others. This is exchange.\" - Robert Swann\n\nReCommon is creating an equitable land tenure framework for democratically managing the intricately connected processes of allocation, continuity, and exchange. It's a scalable, adaptable model that enables people to balance land wealth in private control with the needs of the community and the Earth for regenerative, perpetual stewardship of land.\n\n\u26f0 THE COMMONS CREDIT \u26f0\n\nThe Commons Credit is a whole-systems accounting and valuation methodology for community-held land.\n\nIt serves two primary functions. The first is to properly value any given piece of land, including the ecosystem health, economic capacity, housing, food production, etc. The second is to create a way for ethical investors to finance the purchase of land and get a return on their investment while keeping the ownership within a perpetual trust and stewardship within the community.\n\nThose who invest in \u2018Commons Credits\u2019 are considered Patrons, representing 20 percent of voting power on both the global ReCommon level and on the Bioregional Node level, depending on the origination of the commons credit.\n\nThe Commons Credit serves as the digital record of a piece of land that is in the ReCommon network. When a piece of land enters a Bioregional Node\u2019s stewardship, a Commons Credit is created as the digital representation of the value of that land at that moment and is forever tethered to that piece of land.\n\nAs regenerative practices and community infrastructure are put into place, they increase the wholistic value of the land, which is concurrently recorded and updated in the commons credit, using a smart-contract NFT such as Charged Particles. This ongoing assessment is the whole-systems valuation methodology, and as MRV (measurement, recording, and verification) tools improve over time, the rate at which this assessment happens will trend towards nearly live updates.\n\nThe Commons Credit becomes a way to finance community-centered land regeneration by serving as the fertile middle ground between philanthropic donation and conventional real estate investment.\n\nThe Patron who purchases a commons credit for a particular piece of land doesn\u2019t own that land, which is owned by the bioregional node\u2019s trust, but they are included in both governance and upside in the appreciation of the value of that land.\n\nThe value of the commons credit tracks with the holistic evaluation of that piece of land, which will increase through regenerative use and sustainable development. When the land value goes up, it is reflected in the Commons Credit, and the Patron (the holder of the Commons Credit) can choose to sell it on the open market for profit.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb GOVERNANCE MODEL \ud83c\udfdb\n\nAt the core of our work, we create tools to reclaim, protect, and regenerate land through the use of the Regenerative Community Land Trust (RegenCLT) model of land tenure and governance.\n\nThe RegenCLT model is designed to lower barriers to entry for communities seeking to acquire land through purchase or gift and to develop a permaculture master plan for the site. This place-based plan takes into account the current state of the land, its future uses, its connection to the local and regional economy and community, and the global community at large.\n\nThe RegenCLT model is uniquely capable of acquiring all types of land, returning it to the commons, and stewarding it sustainably for future generations.\n\nGovernance power is shifted from an elected board of directors to the community of members directly, similar to the distributed governance of digital communities like DAOs.\n\nWe combine a \u2018one-person, one-vote' system with the \u2018balanced bucket' structure used by classic CLT boards. The result is that each person has a vote, and each vote goes through a weighted bucket system that directly corresponds to how that voter is connected with the land or project in question.\n\nThese are the 5 voting buckets, each with equal categorical weight:\n- General Members (20%) - people that are members but don\u2019t belong to any delineated subgroup\n- Stewards (20%) - leaseholders of land in trust in the ReCommon network\n- Elders (20%) - rights of nature representatives and holders of indigenous wisdom\n- Patrons (20%) - financial investors and holders of Commons Credits\n- Partners (20%) - partner organizations that provide resources and support in various forms\n\nReCommon follows this governance structure on a global level, and as such anyone can participate. However, each Bioregional Node also follows this structure on a local level.\n\nTo be a member of a Bioregional Node and participate in governance, one must live in that particular bioregion. This leverages the network effects that come from global connectivity while honoring the specificity of place and putting local decision-making first.\n\nAdditionally, Bioregional Nodes may choose to adapt and modify this 5 bucket model to the unique needs and characteristics of their bioregional community.\n\n\ud83c\udf32 WHAT\u2019S A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST? \ud83c\udfd8\n\nAll community land trusts strike the balance between project organizer, developer, and steward. Fortunately enough, the community land trust is a community development tool of uncommon flexibility that can accommodate a wide variety of land uses and development projects. Over the decades since the idea first came to fruition, community land trusts have been pushing the limits of what is possible with this governance framework.\n\nAt ReCommon we are continuing the evolution of the community land trust, integrating decentralized governance and regenerative cryptoeconomics to improve upon existing models.\n\nThe community land trust movement started with radical roots and was part of the \u2018back to the land and village\u2019 revival movements of the 1960s that pursued justice, equality, freedom, and resilient local communities.\n\nHowever, in recent years the movement has taken a turn toward affordable low-income housing. This work is undoubtedly a critical component, but alone it\u2019s not enough to address the complexity of the systemic problems of our time. In many ways, ReCommon embodies a return to the spirit found in the roots of the community land trust movement.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f join us and learn more at www.recommon.land\n\n\ud83c\udf31 \ud83d\ude4c ~ THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ~ \ud83d\ude4c \ud83c\udf31\n",

    "projectDescription": "MRV \u2192 Regenerative Finance \u2192 Regenerative Design and Development\n\ndMeter is creating a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) system. We are in the beginning of this dMRV process and countless building blocks are still missing. There will be problems and limitations that we encounter, but as these gradually get addressed it will become possible to use this new set of lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today.\n\nA.  MRV (monitoring, reporting, and verification) overview\n\nMRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. Measurements may be collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys that empower experts & citizen scientists. Reporting involves describing i) measured data, ii) the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, and iii) potential biases as well as assumptions that went into the data collection/analysis. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that is utilized to ensure the confidence in the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.\n\nDecentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future.\n\nOnce the data is collected, open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase.\n\nMonitoring \n \nIn this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as Filecoin Green. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people\u2019s needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.\n\n Reporting and Verification\n\n Reporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs.\n\n Previous MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, \u201calgorithms-as-a-service\u201d (AaaS) have arisen as a business model. AaaS allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit  from them.  For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves.\n\n Infrastructure\n\n In order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system.\n\n Domain Experts\n\n For each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system.\n\n As these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.\n\nRevenue Sources\nThis dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.\n\nSome of the business cases for dMRV are \ndMRV setup as a service\nRestoration project strategy for insurers\nEcosystem risk area assessment, regeneration plan, and MRV for insurers, municipalities, and eco-tourism enterprises\nEnvironmental Asset Creation- Carbon Credits\n\nHere are some empathy maps showcasing what each business case may be thinking- https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP9wfNe8=/ \n\nCross Organizational Support\nBehind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support.\n\nHere\u2019s a complete map of the organizations that are part of dMeter: https://mm.tt/map/2252789449?t=NhUfVodAtw \n\nB. dMeter organizational structure\n\nThe Principles that dMeter Operates By Is:\n\nLegitimacy\nWe build with integrity, with high standards for quality of data and mindfulness with how it\u2019s collected. We build legitimacy with the communities, stakeholders, and internal contributors involved by striving for alignment of our highest intentions with the day-to-day working processes that move our work forward.\n\nTransparency of Process\nWhen facilitating data collection, making decisions, or building tools, we provide clear documentation of how it was done, enabling people to understand what went into a specific action, decision, or strategy. In this process we aim to be as holistic as possible. \n\nCollaborative interoperability\nData infrastructure needs to be highly interoperable so individuals can take their data with them and use it in different ecosystems, technologies, and use-cases. We create space for collaboration between organizations and focus on the standards that enable interoperability for ecodata.\n\nDistributed & decentralized\nWe distribute and decentralize power. There is no top-down hierarchy in dMeter where you answer to a boss. We self-organize around our strategy and allow leadership to organically arise from the recognition of valuable contributions by the community. We hold ourselves accountable to dMeter as a community and dMRV as a movement, not any individual. Along with that we empower systems that enable anyone anywhere to collect and provide data to the system in a trust minimized way. \n\nClear Responsibility & Accountability\nWe take initiative to define our responsibilities given our role and desires in dMeter, and hold ourselves accountable to these responsibilities on a day-to-day basis. We support each other to take responsibility and accountability by doing it in our own workflow and communications.\n\n\nSome additional info for a deeper dive into dMeter\u2019s strategy and operations can be found here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPLq3DtI=/?moveToWidget=3458764537112892386&cot=14 \n\n \nWorking Groups \nWe\u2019ve adopted working circles. These circles focus on unique aspects of dMeter and work closely together to move forward in sync. Moving forward, we are open to having sub-circles and other circles created as there is a need for more unique work streams that fold into the purpose of dMeter.\n\nDemand Sensing: Understand and develop relationships with users / customers of dMRV \n\nWhat we do:\nAnalyze the potential markets for holistic ecosystem data collection and engage the relevant customers to identify customer needs and opportunities to add value.\nUnderstand unique needs and forge relationships with key users and customers for the holistic data collection and analysis process.\nDefine the use cases that will shape the Engineering circle\u2019s work on designing the data collection and analysis process.\n\nEngineering: Design and implement the ecosystem data collection and analysis process.\n \nWhat We Do:\nCo-create the process for setting up and engaging communities in ecosystem data collection with Demand Sensing\nDefine the process to decide on and implement the tech stack that\u2019s needed for each unique data collection scenario\nCo-create and implement standards for storing ecological data with others working in the MRV space\nWork on the ground with pilot projects to install the technology and engage \u2014\u2014 local stakeholders and independent operators\n\nGovernance and Operations: Steward the dMeter System;

    "projectDescription": "About \u2600\ufe0f\n\nThe Solar Foundation\u2019s mission is to fund solar to under-served communities in emerging markets and developing economies. We want to reinvent the non-profit and NGO model using the tools of web3 to create a new funding model. The new model will help underserved communities access clean energy and have an ownership stake in the solar deployed in their community. The Solar Foundation will fund these projects through donations, micro-loans, and other funding models. Public goods should empower communities; we believe access to electricity is a public good! Our long-term goal is to transfer 100% of the ownership to the communities we serve. \n\nUpdate\n\nSince GR15, our focus at the Solar Foundation has been on helping Ayowecca Uganda, a fellow Gitcoin Grantee in need of solar, to help improve the safety, security, and efficiency of its community-based agroforestry NGO. Ayowecca has made two project requests: 1. Solar lights for the Ayowecca tree nursery; 2. Solar + Storage for critical power needs at their office. We\u2019ve consulted with Ayowecca to determine their needs and how we can best help and have sent crypto to fund the solar lights for the tree nursery. The lights will be purchased from and installed by a local solar installer. \n\nFor the Ayowecca office, we learned that the organization is hoping to move to a new office next year, so ideally, the solar solution should be mobile. We have been researching mobile solar solutions and exploring a potential partnership with the Footprint Project (footprintproject.org).  We hope to pursue a mobile solution that would meet Ayowecca\u2019s needs and provide workforce training and a new source of revenue for the community. We are also working with Footprint Project in Puerto Rico where we will be helping to find some of their work as a part of our GR15 funding commitments.\n\nProblem\n\nClimate change is an existential threat to humanity. The people most affected are in low-income and developing communities. They have directly suffered the most from dirty energy and industry. Electricity is an essential public good that drives economic growth, improves living standards, and alleviates poverty. We aspire to give this good back to the people. Many organizations have been working to solve this complex problem. If a centralized utility company tried to solve the problem, they would construct large fossil fuel-burning power plants and then build a grid of power lines to connect to customers. They would also keep all of the production and infrastructure ownership. This infrastructure does not exist in the parts of the world where energy poverty is an issue. Building traditional power plants and power grids is slow and costly, and the environmental impacts of creating this infrastructure are high. They would significantly contribute to furthering the devastation of climate change. \n\nSolution\n\nWe believe a decentralized approach will be required to solve this problem. Instead of large centralized entities burning coal and other fossil fuels, the Solar Foundation will build localized small solar microgrids and individual systems. These microgrids can supply power to small communities as close to the end-user as possible. Web3 has evolved and can provide the tools necessary to build new funding mechanisms (using the power of DeFi) so that we can focus on funding solar projects. Our vision is to create a foundation that can provide tax efficiency to donors and fund vital solar projects worldwide. Ownership, payments, and system monitoring can all be on the blockchain. This level of transparency, accountability, and ownership will empower the communities we serve. A collaborative approach is essential to solving this problem. We seek to form a strong coalition of web3 and ReFi projects and bring the voices of the communities we serve into the conversation. We will work with local installers to help us install solar to support local economies and continue to support the projects long term so that they have an impact for years to come. \n\nWho we are\n\nJon Ruth has over 15 years of experience developing, managing, and constructing over 400MW of C&I and utility-scale solar projects. He has also been on the nonprofit United Solar Initiative board for six years. Since 2016, Jon has been involved in cryptocurrency, including mining various cryptocurrencies. For 20+ years, Jon has studied climate change and has a passion for building sustainable solutions to one of the most significant challenges humanity faces. Jon is building his legacy by making the maximum impact possible in the fight against climate change. \n\nColeen Chase works on the Gitcoin Public Goods Operations team. She cares deeply about building solutions to address climate change. After adding solar to her family\u2019s home and realizing how difficult it is to implement a microgrid in her community, she is committed to helping implement an equitable transition to renewable energy so that people everywhere can experience a healthier, safer, more secure, and brighter future. \n\nJames loves the problem-solving required to bring new ideas to life. He has collaborated to launch 25+ products into the industrial biotech / renewable energy sector as a scientist, PM, and department manager. He is driven by his love for his kids and the fear for their future if we don't collectively fight to mitigate climate change. \n\nWhy Us\n\nThe Solar Foundation team members have the background to execute this vision because of our combined experience in solar, crypto, web3, and research and our determination to have an environmental and social impact with the projects we build. With a lengthy background in solar and sustainability, Jon is perfectly positioned to develop strong partnerships with solar providers around the globe. He has negotiated millions of dollars of construction contracts over his career and developed solar projects valued at millions of dollars. He has also been on the board of a non-profit developing and funding microgrid projects internationally. Coleen has a marketing background at both Microsoft and Apple along with 10 years experience writing and editing healthcare-related articles and books. She firmly believes in the capability of web3 to help address our urgent climate crisis and in the need for a just transition to clean energy worldwide. James has a passion for solving big problems in the world. Before entering the ReFi space, he was designing new models for tracking carbon and impact in his work in industrial biotech. James was excited earlier this year to find that a whole community was working on some of the problems he had been thinking about for years. He brings value to every project he contributes to and excels at project and people management, community building, and bringing great vibes.\n",

    "projectDescription": "About\nAvano is a proud member of Panvala League. Donations in PAN are much appreciated and can help us access additional matched funding. You can get PAN here: https://app.1inch.io/#/1/unified/swap/DAI/PAN. Avano is also a verified organization on Giveth. Donations on Giveth are much appreciated https://giveth.io/project/return-to-green \n\nThe original idea of Avano (our old name was Akorn) is presented here in an intro video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbmqB3unuI. Since then our work has been separated into two primary sections. Firstly, furthering the creation of a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification system (dMRV). Secondly, empowering synergistic emergence for public good, through art and web3. After the name of each of our sub orgs you can find the percent of funds that will be channeled from funds raised in this round. \n\nThe Avano DAO wiki can be found here: https://avano.gitbook.io/avano/avano and we readily share what we are up to through our Twitter. To check out other projects in the ReFi ecosystem, check out this map we created and feel free to add your organization: https://www.mindmeister.com/map/2145029803?t=AiP70N5AmZ \n\nWe Believe That You Should Hold What You Value. \nTreasury Management:\nWe Have Over 50 NFTs, Many of Which Are From Public Good Organizations including the first NFT created of an Endangered Tree Species from the Endangered Tokens Foundation\nWe have invested in both Eden DAO https://twitter.com/TheEdenDao and Basin DAO https://twitter.com/basinDAO \nWe Hold the Majority of Funding Received in Klima and Regen \n\nDecentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) Systems: dMeter 20% of Funds https://dmeter.super.site/ \n\n75% of funds raised from GR14 by Avano were channeled into a shared treasury initiating dMeter. dMeter is one of the first organizations of its kind. It is an organization of organizations that incentivizes cross organizational (decentralized) collaboration for monitoring, reporting and verification. This dMRV system is particularly geared towards data collection of regenerative actions (such as tree planting) and the benefits from them (such as benefits to water, soil, air, etc.). To further support dMeter\u2019s growth 25% of funds raised by Avano from GR15 were channeled to dMeter. Now 50% of the funds raised from this grant round (GR16), will go towards furthering the newly established Desci branch of dMeter. \n\nImportant Metrics\n\nEstablished dMeter's socials (138+ members in Discord currently)\n\nWG lead's elected (7 different working group leads, each from a unique dMRV organization)\n\nPilot project identified (Ogalla Life in Texas) with future pilots listed (Next likely to be in Paraguay and Colombia. Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/dMeter/comments/vgyf4f/irl_pilot_projects/ )\n\nMechanisms for incentivizing decentralized contributions established USD $1,000 per month for working group leads and Dework for further contributors: https://app.dework.xyz/dmeter \n\nHeld over 95 synchronous dMeter meetings and had input from dozens of individuals from different organizations on development trajectory since last Gitcoin grant round \n\nMapped out dMeter Discord members: https://sobol.io/d/refidao/team/hARhOQGmrr/overview \n\nIdentified and prioritized 12 different writings from past research that are now undergoing a Desci process for formalizing them into publishable papers: https://osf.io/pwr5j/?view_only=399530f253454609a320da3f7ba1c4ec \n\nAvano's founder is currently in New Zealand doing a PhD in regenerative cryptoeconomics and how web3 technology can be applied to hazards and areas impacted by natural disasters. In particular they\u2019re creating a machine learning algorithm for prioritizing conservation of existing ecosystems based on their ability to increase wellbeing and resilience of populations to natural disasters. \nhttps://osf.io/ujhkq/?view_only=3b818fd552fa489fb40e3a6f85dc88ae \n\nAvano\u2019s founder has also started an open source collaborative book that explores various web3 topics, found here: https://avano.gitbook.io/regenerative-cryptoeconomics-book/ \n\nStarted Staking Half of dMeter treasury with https://app.spirals.so/ to further support planetary regeneration \n\nFuture Fund Use\n\nFunds will be used to further incentivize contributions in dMeter. In particular to: \n\nFurther Desci community build and strategic design. As well as each working group that is part of dMeter\n\nWork on Publications. \n\nWork on Shared Infrastructure.\n\nResearch Design. \n\nStrategic Partnerships for Research Being Carried Out. \n\n\nArt and Public Good: Return to Green 20% of Funds Raised https://linktr.ee/returntogreen \n\nThe first ReFi Metaverse event raised 5.3 eth for environmental organizations on Giveth. Organizations responded that this funding allowed them immensely; they established a recycling center in El Salvador and doubled their treasury budget in Brazil for example. There was a full day of ReFi talks (recorded on our Youtube: https://youtu.be/8C3ya7dNulc) from leaders all over the world. Music was streamed into the metaverse from two different stages (12 hours each stage) and 52 NFTs from 40+ artists were auctioned for the environment! \n\nFrom the success of this event a following event was coordinated for September 9th in New Zealand around Mental Health as a public good. There was a custom metaverse space created for a Gender neutral, identity fluid, artist that is a DAO to portray their current work as well as stream the opening exhibition event into the metaverse. This event sent .18ETH to PeepTers, Sage to Saddle, Gravity DAO, and Happy DAO from NFTs sold during the event. Check out the space here: https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=N@4665W,2194S \n\nTo further support linguistic diversity in the crypto space, Return to Green hosted EthSantiago in their custom built boiler room space. This conference was entirely in Spanish. https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=W@2957W,3936N,0.5U \n\nCollaborated with AgroforestDAO to teach school children in Brazil how to build metaverse space and how planning in the metaverse can be useful for agroforestry principles. Can see the result of the collaboration here: https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=N@5196W,1814N \n\nBy working closely with Charged Particles, Return to Green became affiliated with Grandmother Grove https://grandmothergrove.org/ and is now the official voice of Grandmother Gove on Twitter. \n\nImportant Metrics\n\nFor more details on the success of our first event can go here: https://medium.com/@Avano/refi-metaverse-event-how-to-ad91ae69afd8 \n\n161 followers on our Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReFiNFT \n\nWe now own 2 metaverse spaces in Cryptovoxels and over 70 spaces in Over the Reality \n\nOver 700 visits to Agroforest DAO metaverse collaboration space\n\nOver 700 visits to EthSantiago space\n\nOver 6500 visits to our primary exhibition space: https://www.voxels.com/parcels/4147\n\nOver 400 visits to the Mental Health Event space \n\nFrom Our Impact Became a Verified Organization on Giveth https://giveth.io/project/return-to-green  \n\nContinued collaboration with IRL artist venue XCHC https://xchc.co.nz/ \n\nFuture Fund Use\n\nFurther support web3 technology adoption (especially metaverse) in South America Through Strategic Partnerships: EthSantiago, Endangered Foundation, and Agroforest DAO \n\nPurchase of Streaming Hardware for New Zealand Based Events \n\nContinued Work WIth New Zealand Artist Community in Adopting and Utilizing Web3 Technology \n\nIncrease the Ability to Perpetually Plant Trees Through Grandmother Grove \n\nPublic Good NFT Marketplace: FeNXT NFT Marketplace 60% of Funds Raised\n\nFrom the efforts of Return to Green, the need for an NFT marketplace that supports public good projects on Giveth was identified. Raid Guild was contracted for a design sprint of this marketplace After the design sprint was completed the results were shared on various forums of organizations that support public good. With the word getting out that we were wanting to start fundraising to create an MVP of this marketplace we were approached by Inverter Network a branch of PrimeDAO, asking if we were interested in being one of the first web3 organizations to utilize their newly created fundraising system. We were very intrigued and are now going to be part of their trial run in February. Can learn more about this marketplace here: https://gov.charged.fi/t/fenxt-nft-marketplace \n\nImportant Metrics\n\nUSDC $8,000 was spent to contract Raid Guild on a Design Sprint\n\nCreated many forum posts sharing the idea, example post here: https://gov.charged.fi/t/fenxt-nft-marketplace \n\nReceived Brand Guide from Raid Guild: https://www.figma.com/proto/IW6RiBBq6JiUFpQNsIUGfw/PGNFTMKT-Brand-Design?node-id=4%3A10&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=4%3A10\n\nReceived Scope of Work for What Needs to Be Built From Raid Guild: \nhttps://hackmd.io/IgJL2pxfSXWo35UKhROuYg?edit\n\nAccumulated a Contact List of Organizations to Reach Out To When Launching Fundraising Campaign with Inverter in February  \n\nFuture Fund Use\n\nMarket Fundraising Campaign \n\nHire DAO(s) (Raid Guild, General Magic, Buidl Guild etc.) to Build MVP of Marketplace ",

We need to  revalue biodiversity and living ecosystems through preservation of Endangered Species which are invaluable assets to the world. \n\u2014------------------------\n\ud83e\udd14 Why support us? \n\u2014------------------------\n\n\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcabProblem to Solve\n\n\ud83c\udf33Endangered trees are responsible for maintaining the health of most of the world's endangered forest ecosystems, but rarely produce relevant revenue for landowners (without being damaged) and even become financial liabilities, thus encouraging their illegal felling. \n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4cEndangered Tokens\u2019 Solution\n\nLeverage web3 and digital art to incentivize the protection of these scarce beings by changing their status from merely the cost of maintaining a tree to a revenue producing Bio-Asset. \ud83c\udf0f\n\n\u2014------------------------------------\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f How will we accomplish this?\n\u2014------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEndangered Tokens is a ReFi & DeSci NFT community looking to revalue biodiversity by tokenizing georeferenced endangered trees. Each specimen is characterized and video recorded alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWith the funds raised we will help landowners finance the protection of endangered Forest with reforestation, verification of carbon credits from the forests and the creation of quality digital content & data to add value to the tokens, content like:\n\n-3D tourism experience of the protected forests thus reducing the footprint of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to keep supporting the protection of the forests. \n-Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for video games and/or augmented reality experiences\n-Recording data from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, bioacoustics, video recording of the ecosystems, climate data, water flow, among other relevant information.\n\n\nNFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to biodiversity assets for the future. \n\n\n\n\u2014---------------------------------------------------\n\ud83c\udf33Which kind of trees are we talking about?\n\u2014--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are currently working in Chile in South America, with the rare species Gomortega Keule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. These magnificent beings are the last one of the Gomortegacae Family, dating its evolution to Pangea times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (Scarcer than Bitcoin!)\n\n\n\n\n\u2014----------------------------------------------\n\ud83d\udcb8How will grant funding be spent?\n\u2014----------------------------------------------\n\n\u2014\n1\ufe0f\u20e3.-Production and development of the first web3 touristic Endangered Forest experience.\n\n*First mock-up video of one of the 3d model replicas of the tokenized trees.*\n[Youtube video link](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Je4vC5g50)\n\n\n\u2014\n2\ufe0f\u20e3.- Vital activities core team funding\n- [x] General administration\n- [x] Coding and development\n- [x] Marketing and community growth\n- [x] NGO's and landowners coordination\n- [x] Content creation and production\n\n\n\u2014\n3\ufe0f\u20e3.- Endangered Tokens Conservation program\n\n*\ufe0f\u20e3Tokenization, extensive cadastre & landowner agreements\n*\ufe0f\u20e3in-situ conservation actions to reduce threats. \n*\ufe0f\u20e3Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions\n*\ufe0f\u20e3Sustainable local development & community engagement\n*\ufe0f\u20e3Research on species and their habitats\n*\ufe0f\u20e3Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3.-Marketing and community building\n\nWe have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3.- Biodiversity Assets Research & Development\n\nIn order to fully convert our protected trees to biodiversity Assets we think a proper indicator with a Minimum Reliable Verification (MRV) of the health status of the trees and species must be accomplished. In order to achieve this we will foster a DeSci project that aims to gather Bio-Acoustic data from different forests with different conditions and generate a machine learning algorithm that can automatically diagnose the living conditions within an ecosystem. \n\n\u2014-------------------------------------------------\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0fState of the art & ongoing projects\n\u2014------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2638\ufe0fThe Tokents: Digital assets with ReFi purpose\n\nWe are creating NFT collections that help us fundraise and add value to our community.

The first product that is ready-to-launch from this is the Queule 3D showroom to explore the modeled trees as a virtual experience. \nWe are developing a Virtual Reality Experience of the Endangered Queule Forest as a product to offer to our holders and also to Scale our ReFi Model. \n\n\n\u2638\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5Music of the ENTS\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5\n\nAlongside the virtual experience we are recording the frequencies of the endangered trees through a PlantsPlay device (www.plantsplay.com) as the first approach. Our vision is to be able to stream the music of the endangered trees live, so they can produce their own content to help them stay alive.\n\n\n\u2638\ufe0f  DeSci projects to be developed \ud83e\uddea\n\n\n# Bio-Acoustic MRV\nIn order to understand the forest better, we need to learn how its sounds speaks regarding the health of the forest.This way we will be able to use a cheap and effective MRV for our forests and contribute to the ReFi community with more tools and infrastructure for better MRVs\n\n\n# Dendrochronology of long lived trees to understand climate change.\n\nWith the proper tools and scientific professionals measuring the age of long lived trees and its roots can help us understand more about their endangered situation. \n\n# Queule Frog studies \ud83d\udc38\nFrogs are very important bioindicators of the forest. There is a rare frog that only lives nearby Queule forests and we are already researching regarding their behavior and ways to protect them. \n\n\n\n\n\nLinks of Interest\n[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/endangeredtokens)\n\n( To see a rich text and full version of the grant description go to:  https://hackmd.io/@vrXnknFqSEq7faTi-zgdxw/r1DIJgDys )\n\n\n\n",

We need to come out of our bubbles.\n\nThat is why  \ud83c\udf31we need to unite\ud83c\udf31, we need to get to know each other, build trust and help each other be as successful as possible in building solutions.\n\nRegens Unite is a fresh way of bringing Regens together in real life, to build a strong web between all the different types of regenerative sectors, both in and outside of web3, so that we can learn from each other and foster new avenues of collaboration & unification. \n\nOur in-person events bring together regenerative thinkers and doers in DAOs, ReFi, DeSci, Platform Coops, Purpose Organizations, Climate Activism, NGOs, and Art to co-create & share projects, knowledge, food, kindness and hope.\n\n\ud83c\udf40 What are Regen Unite events like? \n\nPeople have expressed awe and surprise by whom they\u2019ve met and by the different approach Regens Unite events have taken. Regens Unite events are not typical conferences. No powerpoints, no convincing each other of solutions, but uniting in our common goal: regenerate ourselves, regenerate how we communicate & collaborate, and regenerate the planet.\n\nThese unconference-style events include:\n\u2b55\ufe0f Facilitated workshops\n\u2b55\ufe0f Round circle discussions\n\u2b55\ufe0f Co-creation spaces\n\u2b55\ufe0f Relaxation areas\n\nSome of the reactions we received in the feedback form on the question \u2018what surprised you?\u2019\n\n\u2728 Solid female presence, and people who didn\u2019t know what web 3 was (YES)\n\u2728 I was positively surprised, that not only people from crypto world attended\n\u2728 The leaning into regeneration as a personal, interpersonal human need as well as environmental regeneration\n\n\n\ud83c\udf40 How can we help your community?\n\nWe have developed an expertise in organising conferences where people can make new meaningful connections and feel rejuvenated. We learned how to create safe and brave spaces where people can meet other people outside of their bubble.\n\nWe can put that expertise of service to your community, to help you organise a Regens Unite Hub at your conference, a Regen Retreat, or find ways to bring more diversity to your community.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf40 What\u2019s next for Regens Unite?\n\nThere is a reason that greenpilling is such a strong movement: the understanding that we do not want to recreate current global system imbalances by building in a silo. We need to build bridges, we need to connect to our neighbours and to offline communities.\n\nThere is a lot more potential in the ideas behind Regens Unite. We are now organising to become a DAO to help each other create those spaces where Regens can unite in every city and every region.\n\nOur goal is to facilitate more events in 2023, produce great content around the movement, and help Regens unite around the world. Every donation helps us to move this mission forward!\n\n\n\ud83c\udf40 Our recent events\n\nBogot\u00e1 (Regen Hub @ Devcon) - October 11-14 2022\nhttps://regensunite.earth/bogota\n\n\u200dBerlin - September 16-17 2022\nhttps://regensunite.earth/berlin\n\nAmsterdam - September 22-24 2022\n\nBrussels - May 19-20 2022\nhttps://regensunite.earth/brussels\n\n\n\n",

    "projectDescription": "KOKO DAO is on a mission to reduce deforestation in Colombia \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf4\n\nWe work closely with the local communities to create viable economic models as an alternative to deforestation.\n\n\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\n\n\nWhy Focus on Small Scale Forests? \ud83c\udf33\n\nRural communities and small land owners\u00a0have neither the resources nor sufficient amounts of land to receive compensation from forest preservation efforts through carbon offsets. This makes deforestation the most economically compelling option for them.\n\nFortunately, blockchains allow us to demonstrate the proof of impact of small scale conservation projects in a transparent and trustless way. \u2028This makes it possible for us to design new ways to compensate rural communities for preserving their land.\n\nWhy Colombia? \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf4 \n\nColombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world, the first in varieties of birds, orchids and butterflies.\nThis biodiversity depends largely on the survival of ecosystems like forests. \n\n50% of Colombia\u2019s territory is covered by forests, however, we are losing 500 hectares of forests every single day.\n\nWhat is causing deforestation in Colombia? \ud83e\ude93\ud83d\udd25\n\n- Lack of opportunities and education in rural communities. \n- Solutions to forest preservation like carbon credits are not a sustainable economic model for small-scale forests.\n- Increasing deforestation in protected areas like national parks.\n- Cattle farming and extensive agriculture\n- Ilegal drugs production \n- Lack of infrastructure \n\nHow do we avoid deforestation? \ud83d\udc12\n\n\nOur model aims to create avoided deforestation credits for small scale forests and collectives. Supporting local communities to actively create and manage their own projects. \nMore info and model in our website www.kokodao.xyz \n\n\nWhere is the money going? \ud83d\udcb5\n\n- Onboarding non web3.0 impact projects to crypto\n- Recruiting team for social media and product development\n- Support local school in the creation of an endemic tree nursery\n- dMRV technology implementation in our pilot project: 15 hectares of native forest in Huila, Colombia.\n- Legal expenses. \n\n\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\n\nFind all our docs in: \n\nWebsite: https://kokodao.xyz/\n\nNotion: https://kokodao.notion.site/KOKO-DAO-c2250b8ab58548ad8a0cf487ff4f4522\n\nOther links: \nTwitter:@kokodaoxyz  https://twitter.com/kokodaoxyz\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/B2vgk7NwHq\n\nYouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6a6fJ9W4Vg\nContact: hello@kokodao.xyz\n\nKokodaoxyz.eth \n\nThank you for your support \ud83d\udc9a",

    "projectDescription": "About Shamba:\n\nShamba is building a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) network to power regenerative finance - ReFi. Shamba also runs an ecological data oracle powering several web3 applications.\n\nWhat we have achieved since GR15:\n\nSince GR15 we have completed the development of our web app solution to support farmers getting into regenerative finance. We are now deploying this solution with farmers who want to start regenerative projects. (https://refi.shamba.app)\n\nBuilding off of our success deploying the first web3 ecological data oracle last year (learn more at https://docs.shamba.app), we are now aiming to roll out a full digital MRV solution to support the ReFi projects.\n\nLast year also saw us roll out tools for analyzing satellite imagery from various space agencies (https://insights.shamba.app) as well as tools for generating smart contract code that uses satellite data (https://contracts.shamba.app). These tools were developed to support the developer community to easily utilize ecological data in their web3 applications.\n\nWhy MRV: \n\n\nCarbon projects MRV has traditionally been expensive and oriented toward large-scale projects.\n\nOur goal is to make MRV affordable by leveraging satellite data, machine learning, geospatial modeling and ground sampling. We aim to combine this with a network of skilled people to provide the data needed to characterize natural landscapes and quantify the impact of regenerative actions.\n\nWe aim to provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional MRV which is unaffordable to the typical smallholder. Once deployed, our solution will enable smallholders to access MRV services at an affordable cost.\n\nAlpha Round Goal:\n\nIn this round, we aim to fund the collection of scientific data to establish carbon stock baselines. As we support farmers kicking off carbon project pilots in Kenya, we need to create datasets that reflect the above-ground and below-ground carbon stocks on these farmlands to act as baselines. This will allow farmers to quantify in the future the impact of their regenerative activities on carbon stocks by having a point of reference at the start of the activities.\n\nBaseline data:\n\nThe data we collect will be synthesized into carbon maps that will be available to anyone who needs such data. Open data is one of the most important classes of public goods and we believe the datasets we produce will impact multiple projects and serve multiple beneficiaries.\n\nThe data will benefit not only small farmers launching carbon projects but also researchers and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions around the climate and agriculture.\n\nPilot sites:\n\nWe will begin by mapping out carbon stocks in several sites in Kenya where pilot projects are starting, then expand to cover other bioregions as we refine our techniques. The funds we receive on this Alpha round will inform the geographical extent we can map under this initiative.\n\nTarget datasets:\n\nWe aim to create soil maps and land use land cover maps to quantify below and above-ground carbon stocks. \n\nWe will use a combination of ground sampling, remote sensing, secondary data and geospatial modeling in creating these datasets.\n\nLearn More:\n\nGet more details on our plans to collect baseline data for carbon stocks across African farmlands by visiting this link:\n\nhttps://shamba.notion.site/Shamba-Gitcoin-Alpha-Round-Page-3cf3475e7bc64d8f9a649aadf4f4a37e\n\n\nVote of thanks:\n\nWe thank you for supporting us in developing our solution and look forward to your support as we roll ReFi out to rural farmers across the Global South.",

    "projectDescription": "WaterDAO GR16\ud83d\udca7\n\nThis WaterDAO grant is a continuation of the ReFi DAO Water Circle grant made in GR15. Since GR15 the WaterDAO has grown quickly. The WaterDAO has already begun multiple research projects such as credit class development, solvent extraction desalination testing, and Solar energy desalination analysis tool feasibility. The WaterDAO also has two pilot projects planned to begin in 2023 to treat water. The goal of this grant is to help to bring the first RH2O credits on chain earlier than expected by focusing on developing automated monitoring systems and broadening our verification efforts. \n\nThe purpose of the WaterDAO is to create transparency around sources of water, how they are generated, and establish a water credit classification system. We believe this can be done by creating a trustworthy and verifiable water credit that can be easily purchased and used to offset water usage. This would allow companies to continue to focus on their operational efficiencies while supporting the replacement of their water usage with equally efficient water producers.\n\nThe purpose of the WaterDAO can be summed up through four main goals:\n\n1. Create a universally accepted water credit that is first supported by the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) community and eventually, by larger outside organizations. This credit class can serve as a building block for many types of water credits to be created.\n\n2. The WaterDAO will act as a support mechanism to verify credit quality. The DAO will oversee specific verification standards to provide a certain level of quality, standard for the credits issued through the DAO.  \n\n3. Incentivize companies to be \"Water Positive\" or at lease Water Neutral. This will come as the DAO expands and gains more influence. The DAO will make the process of becoming \"Water Positive\" a significantly easier process than it was previously, leaving companies fewer excuses to maintain their indifference. \n\n4. Incentivize more environmentally friendly forms of desalination and other water treatments. This is done through a tiered credit system. For example, a water producer using desalination methods that require energy intensive methods and that has a potentially damaging runoff, would only qualify for second tier credits. To receive top tier credits, water producers must power their operations with cleaner and less energy intensive methods while mitigating harmful runoff. \n\nRH2O water credits will be validated through the Regen Network. \n\nIf you are interested in joining our mission, please visit our website and join the Discord channel to get involved, we look forward to seeing you!\n\nA little bit more information if you have read this far:\n\nThe WaterDAO will not only be validating water credits, but also actively working towards increasing the development of water treatment and credits by funding targeted areas that the DAO deems to be impactful. These areas will likely include:\n\n-Funding of specific tier 1 water treatment projects\n\n-Water technology development\n\n-Pilot projects leading to IP development\n\n-Sponsor water research and development\n\n-Acquisition of a specific water asset that can be licensed to water projects\n\nBy funding water treatment projects, the WaterDAO is able to further develop the water credit space. The WaterDAO treasury will hold assets that are created or purchased by that DAO. These assets can be licensed out to water producers to help them provide higher tiered credits. The DAO will get to vote on the licensing agreements for specific projects as well as which ventures will receive funding. \n\nValidating water credits:\n\nEach credit validated by the WaterDAO represents one cubic meter of additional treated water that is added back into the water system that is represented by the credit. Water generators who participate in the WaterDAO can mine water credits using Proof of Water (PoW). Once a water generating facility is certified to produce regenerative water (e.g. solar desalination), it will receive a blockchain-enabled IoT smart meter that communicates directly with the network through Proof of Water. PoW is a way to secure water by ensuring that every regenerative water credit (RH2O) is backed by a physical unit of water mined on the RH2O network. Water miners are rewarded with water credits by using Proof of Water to validate the generation of a unit of water and communicate the data associated with that unit of water through the IoT smart meter. In the future RH2O tokens will serve as water contracts where physical water can be collected. In addition, the physical mining of water ensures that the creation (supply) of water credits is limited by the capacity to generate physical water and the value of each RH2O token is a function of the balance between supply (miners) and demand (users).\n\nThe WaterDAO will have specific credit classes based on the Regen Network that water producers must fall under in order to produce a specific credit. The first water credit will be for desalination projects and will generate RH2O (Regenerative Water Credit) tokens. Each Regenerative Water Credit measures one cubic meter of treated water that is added back to a specific water system. In other words, these credits are localized and set to the specific water system in which the water has been added. RH2O credits are only produced when water is verifiably added back into a water system.\n\nWe will create three tiers of water credits based on the applications suitable for the quality of treated water. The credit tiers are based on a 100-point scale designed to promote the activities we deem to be the most advantageous for the health of the environment and to stimulate technological innovation.\n\nThose wishing to be funded through the DAO will be required to fill out an application form. Once completed, the DAO review committee will evaluate the results and assign values based on eight parameters.\n\nThe results of the application will designate the project as one of the three water credit tiers based off of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the treated water.\n\nPotable Water Class: TDS less than 400 ppm and sterilized\n\nAgriculture Class: TDS less than 700 ppm and healthy for the environment.\n\nIndustrial Class: Water of any TDS with a pre-approved buyer or application.\n\nThe WaterDAO could really use your support both through GR16 as well as participation in the DAO. We hope to see you around. Thank you for your contribution \ud83d\ude4f.\n",

    "projectDescription": "**ReSci Network is leading ethical, ecosystem regeneration-centric Decentralized Science (DeSci)**\n\nWhat?\n\nIn many fields, industry bends the arm of science and casts a veil of validity via \u201cpeer reviewed studies\u201d to influence the public\u2019s perception of a product. \nHere on the emerging frontier of ecocredits, we have the opportunity to shift the paradigm of industry science away from centralized + corrupt to one that is decentralized + credible. ReSci posits that an entity benefiting financially from the creation and/or sale of a given ecocredit should not be involved in the process of reviewing a methodology for approval and adoption as an ecocredit. \nThus, ReSci Network aims to provide independent review in order to best prevent potential conflicts of interest. \n\n**Our essential responsibility is to assure that ethical science is at the core of ecocredit methodology development and peer review. To this end, we act as a community leader catalyzing the formation and flourishing of distributed communities of regenerative practice** \n\nHow? \n\nWe hold a 3-pronged approach for achieving our mission\n\n1. Scientist and Methodology Project Databases\n\nHuman capital and expertise are crucial to achieving a project\u2019s mission. We\u2019ve created a two-part database in a public-facing Notion so that projects developing methodologies can find scientists with appropriate expertise (and vice versa) to consult while they are in the early stages of developing their methodology concept. \n\nScientists: Please visit https://notionforms.io/forms/resci-network-scientist-directory-intake-form to complete database intake \n\nMethodology Projects: Please visit https://notionforms.io/forms/methodology-project-directory-intake-form to complete database intake. \n\nWe appreciate your participation!\n\n2. Communications Hub\nHosted in console.xyz, our communications hub is designed to natively host curated conversation as well as relevant resources such as Notion. Scientists and Methodology Projects alike can request access after completing intake to our database. The goal of the comms hub is to spark connection for collaboration and to support the methodology development and peer review sprints that we hold space for. \n\n3. Methodology Development and Peer Review Sprints \nMethodology Development sprints are intended for projects who have received approval of a concept note (from Regen Network or similar) and have not yet begun the process of methodology definition beyond a general outline. \nPeer review sprints are reserved for groups that have dedicated a significant amount of resources to the development of a methodology (specifically, collaboration with credentialed scientists). These projects are at the stage of a first draft whitepaper. \n\nWe at ReSci Network are passionate about the role of ethical science in ecosystem regeneration. We believe that holistic ecocredits, if implemented via methodologies developed by ethical science, can act as a crucial component in a flywheel mechanism for long term funding in environmental stewardship. \n\n___\nHow You Can Help\nPlease help us reach our goal of raising a total of $25k in Gitcoin\u2019s Climate Alpha round by making any donation that is accessible to you and by sharing our project link to others who are passionate about science\u2019s role in ecosystem regeneration. \n\nWith $25k, we will be able to perform a full scale alpha methodology development and peer review sprint.  Funds will be allocated to sprint stewards,  a communications steward, and scientists who contribute to the sprint. Within the container of an 8 week sprint, we aim to compensate scientists at a competitive rate of $50/hr for their expertise. Beyond the cost of the sprint, funds will be allocated to cover a. further research of appropriate legal entities that can meet the needs of a truly decentralized scientific community and b. basic legal costs of organization upkeep. \n\nWe were selected as a runner-up project in the December 2022 Future Quest Climate Pool and need funding to be able to sustain our momentum in building and weaving. Thank you for supporting our sustenance and nourishment through the winter. \ud83d\udc3b \ud83d\udc9a\n\nSincerely, \nSage and Ned\n",

    "projectDescription": "### Wouldn't it be nice to create a perpetual protocol backed by natural assets unrelated to the crypto market, and eco-friendly and regenerative?\n\nI'm Wasabi, the founder of Kokonut Network. We are building a bridge to connect web3 and agriculture. We are creating a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of coconut farms.\n\nOur main goal is to address the worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects. We help farmers get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access to perpetual natural assets.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nKokonut Network provides blockchain governance and open-source accounting to the agricultural industry. Our mission is to promote, organize, fund, and manage coconut farms. We collect funds from the community through the Kokonut DAO framework for decision-making and allocating treasury funds.\n\nKokonut Network can establish a lifetime partnership with its members through the Kokonut DAO by using a formula of Agriculture, Blockchain, Web3, Perfect Soil, and Weather. This opportunity does not have an expiration date, as coconut trees are replanted once they stop bearing fruits.\n\n**One-time contribution equals a lifetime of rewards and benefits.**\n\n## Why coconuts? Zero Waste Circular By Default Crop.\n\nCoconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.\n\nKokonut V1 is a real-world eco-friendly agriculture project in its plantation phase. We have obtained planting permits and 620 acres of soil-tested land in optimal conditions, with access to water and the best weather in the region.\n\n**Coconut products market outlook**\n\nThe coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.\n\nCoconut is a versatile fruit with many health benefits. Its derivatives, such as coconut oil, water, milk, desiccated coconut, coir, and copra, are used in the food, beverage, cosmetic, and personal care industries.\n\n### Kokonut V1\n\nOur first plantation will yield 18 million coconuts annually, enabling us to generate multiple revenue streams in the food, health, and automotive industries.\n\nThis project will benefit the entire society of the Municipality of Las Salinas, Barahona Province, Dominican Republic. The coconut plants will be planted 7.5 x 7.5 meters apart, equating to ninety-six (96) plants per acre of land, or 60,000 plants across the six hundred and twenty (620) Acres of land. This variety of coconut yields approximately three hundred (300) fruits per plant, resulting in an annual yield of 18,000,000 units. The Kokonut DAO treasury will receive 100% of the profits.\n\nThe organization seeks to create 10,663 direct and indirect jobs through investments in this project. These jobs will focus on essential agricultural tasks such as weeding, applying pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation, and harvesting.\n\nLearn more: https://kokonut.network/kokonut-v1\n\n### **Kokonut DAO**\n\n*The DAO is the core vehicle for all fundraising, rewards distributions, and governance decisions.*\n\nKokonut Network is a platform built by and for people. At its core, Kokonut DAO seeks to empower anyone who adds value to the Kokonut Network ecosystem, regardless of their social status or prior accomplishments.\n\nLearn more: https://kokonut.network/dao\n\n### **Our Vision**\n\nKokonut Network was created with the aim of reducing the obstacles to agricultural development, and rural project funding, and democratizing investment in real-world projects. We will use blockchain technology to establish multiple plantations across the country, providing advantages to the global crypto communities and everyone in the network.\n\n### **What makes us different?**\n\nMany DAOs have great ideas, copywriting, and marketing, but without a solid business model. Unfortunately, many of these projects are rug-pulled or abandoned by users due to a lack of quality products.\n\nKokonut Network has a distinct approach. Rather than establishing our proposal or business plan by taking advantage of our users, and attempting to get them to purchase some non-backed token, we have created a resilient system over time. It is backed by coconut plants on our land and has a DAO for governance, funds allocation, and rewards sharing.\n\nLearn more: https://kokonut.network/about\n\n## How are we doing so far?\n\nHere is a simple list of completed tasks: budget research, business model, revenue streams, and technical details about the Kokonut Network.\n\n- Lifetime Profitable Business Plan\n- Government Agricultural Permits\n- Agricultural Company Registration\n- Core team Selection\n- Full Fledge Budget\n- 620 Acres of Land\n- Multilingual Agriculture Software\n- Kokonut v1 Soil Test\n- \u201cAs Seen On\u201d Public Speaking, Podcasts Interviews [https://link.kokonut.network/press]\n\nResources\n\n- https://www.kokonut.network/\n\n- Let\u2019s have a chat at https://link.kokonut.network/meeting\n\n- Web3 Workspace https://link.kokonut.network/charmverse <> Get a meeting for a Guest NFT :)\n\n- DAO Governance https://link.kokonut.network/dao\n\n- Join our Discord https://link.kokonut.network/discord\n\n- Kokonut Blog https://office.kokonut.network/blog",

    "projectDescription": "\n\ud83c\udf3f About \ud83c\udf3f\n\nThe Impact App (TIA) is a mobile dApp for on-boarding + paying Regenerators & verifying practice-based climate solutions.\n\nTIA is a project developed by Eco Labs, in coordination with key partners & collaborators: dMeter, Silvi, Digital Gaia, Regen Network open source methods registry, ReFi DAO, KokoDAO, Coffee & Carbon Collective, AgroforestDAO, ReFi Zone, Regen League, and Common Action / Myseelia. TIA will be complementary to other ReFi and dMRV projects and benefit the entire ecosystem by reducing on-boarding friction, and helping increase the supply of new ecological assets.\n\nTLDR: Eco Labs is a collaborative on-boarding ecosystem for regenerative action. TIA is a mobile dApp that does three things:\n\n1) Reduce friction by guiding people into ReFi projects that value impactful action\n2) Collect on-the-ground data used to issue ecological assets such as Eco Credits on Regen Network\n3) Pay Regenerators anywhere in the world by integrating with Celo\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4 UPDATES: Thank you to all the regens who supported us in GR15 \ud83d\udc9a\n\nthis is what we've been up to the last few months:\n\n1) Methodology Development - we worked with Djimo from Silvi Protocol & Diogo from AgroforestDAO to submit a concept note to Regen Network for our \u201cAdaptive Agroforestry and Smallholder Stewardship'' methodology we\u2019ve been developing while in Colombia. We also launched a 9 week collaborative sprint where we brought together folks like Ana Maria from KokoDAO, Darina from Coffee Carbon Collective, and Charlie from ReCommon to support each other in writing and editing methodologies.\n\n2) Grants & Accelerators - we participated in batch 6 of Celo Camp, received an additional NSF grant to do 100 stakeholder interviews (starting February), and were honored to be one of the first 17 winners of the Future Quest grants! \n\n3) Pilot Projects - our team spent 3 months in Barichara, Colombia where we developed relationships with a network of regenerative projects, syntropic agroforestry food forests, and community farms. We learned a ton about regenerative practices and were able to begin development on the methodology mentioned above. The next step will be to return to Colombia this Spring and start implementing and testing the methodology & technology stack for dMRV with at least 3 specific pilot projects around Barichara.\n\n4) Technical Lead for Eco Labs - during our time in Colombia, we had the pleasure of getting to meet & befriend Jillian Burrows, an extremely talented & experienced programmer with a diverse & esoteric range of interests & knowledge. We\u2019re so excited to bring her on to Eco Labs as our technical lead, where she\u2019ll be helping us weave together the many collaborative pieces that make up our ecosystem & products. \n\n\ud83c\udfaf Q1 goals: \ud83c\udfaf\n\n1) additional fundraising - as we continue development of our tech stack, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ll need a lot more resources to successfully weave together an effective tool & platform. \n\n2) stakeholder research - we\u2019ll be conducting extensive research & interviews on the market potential for Eco Credits\n\n3) testing on-boarding & dMRV solutions on-the-ground in Barichara & other pilot locations around the world \n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc Full Description: \ud83d\udcdc\n\nThere is a growing number of people who want to take action to help regenerate our planet. This includes both existing land stewards who could benefit from more sustainable & resilient income, as well as communities who need to restore their local natural resources and build resiliency. One option for them to do so is to sell assets into the voluntary carbon or ecosystem services markets. However, the way that market is designed makes it difficult for would-be Regenerators to participate, as the costs for MRV (measuring, reporting, and verifying) their efforts are substantial, and therefore work only for large, professional projects.\n\nThere is simultaneously a growing amount of capital being raised to fund impactful activities, through for instance: NFT fundraising, individual donors, & companies who are committed to net-zero and other social good commitments. In expectation of increased demand, more and more markets for ecosystem services are being developed. As Nori founder Paul Gambil says \"demand (for high-quality carbon credits) is not the problem, supply is\".\n\nOne barrier for increasing supply is the lack of decentralized, low-cost MRV solutions. This remains a friction point for small-scale, community-initiated impact projects to start and scale quickly. Nonetheless, such projects represent the fastest and most robust path towards impact, as small communities form a ready-made, decentralized global community which has the capacity and incentives to develop a wide variety of local projects and maintain them over the long term.\n\nEco Labs aims to reduce the friction of these two forces connecting: Patrons (markets that support impactful activities), and Regenerators (people who want to get paid to take action). \n\n\u2747\ufe0f The Solution: \u2747\ufe0f\n\nThe Impact App is an app designed to on-board Regenerators into existing dMRV platforms and collect data in-app to provide additional basic dMRV solutions. It will include both a directory of user-friendly how-to guides for existing low-cost, transparent, and verifiable methods of impactful actions that anyone can get paid to do in their local environment, as well as versatile, adaptable, and modular solutions for innovative forms of smartphone based data collection. It will be built in collaboration with existing and newly forming communities & DAOs to seamlessly co-create custom methodologies that measure, verify, and compensate for regenerative actions of all types.\n\nThis mobile app & platform aims to help bridge the gap and reduce the friction between those who value impact (ReFi projects, carbon & eco credit registries & marketplaces, ImpactNFT collections, and Impact DAOs) and those who practice impactful & regenerative actions (Regenerators like farmers, land stewards, urban Regenerators, climate activists, etc.)\n\nBy aggregating, integrating, and partnering with existing dMRV platforms, TIA will be able to act as an index to guide Regenerators on exactly what options are available to them, how to start taking action & get educated on regenerative practices.TIA will build custom data collection tools built into the app to:\n\n1) on-board new Regenerators into both established and developing ReFi & dMRV ecosystems\n\n2) provide direct-to-impact financing for small-scale regenerative projects\n\n3) increase the supply of new carbon & eco credits to carbon market platforms by improving accessibility, awareness, and education\n\n4) facilitate knowledge exchange within communities by integrating with projects like Common Action\n\n5) ultimately increase the volume of net carbon sequestration, watershed & soil health, habitat biodiversity, ecosystem restoration, and other regenerative practices\n\nWhy build an app?\n\nAn app makes accessing & recording information simple, which can:\n\n1) Increase awareness of and make on-boarding easier for organizations that have ways of valuing impact, for example: Nori, Regen Network, Open Forest Protocol, EcoNavi, dClimate, Digital Gaia, Orgo, Pozzle Planet, Littercoin, TIST, and many more.\n\n2) Provide those who value impact that aren\u2019t currently implementing MRV solutions to create simple systems of data collection that verify impactful actions on-the-ground.\n\nHow will it work?\n\nThis Android and iOS mobile application will be built to serve multiple functions:\n\n1) List an index/directory of all actions one can take which already have a funding counter-party and an existing MRV methodology.\n\n2) Provide simple, user-friendly, step by step guides on how to utilize existing MVR methodologies & obtain a Bioregional Passport\n\n3) Facilitate in-app payments to regenerative actors by integrating with Celo, a mobile compatible blockchain.\n\n4) Register and verify information about its users using the Common Action ontology in order to filter what actions that individual can feasibly take part in (such as location, expertise, access to land + size and existing resources on that land, access to a vehicle, physical capabilities/disabilities, etc.) as well as link their profiles to Common Action to find experts, peers and resources that will help them on their regenerative journey\n\n5) Collect data for custom methodologies using in-app tools such as images, video, location, audio, & temperature. Upload that data in public and transparent formats using IPFS / Filecoin such that anyone is able to verify and cross reference.\n\n6) Provide resources & clear pathways for regenerative actors to obtain additional equipment or expertise which can increase the quality of data collected / increase pay. This could take the form of classes, obtaining certifications, purchasing IoT sensors or specialized measurement equipment needed to unlock higher paying methodologies.\n\n7) Optionally redirect funds paid for regenerative actions to purchase products in-app, such as dynamic NFTs which can showcase & illustrate ones impact over time, and merchandise / accessories / tools which aid the regenerative actions (UV-protective clothing, knee-pads, gloves, tools tailored to specific methodologies)\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Collaborations: \ud83d\udc96\n\nRegen Network Methodologies\nWith their many decentralized methodologies being developed, Regen Network will enable Project Developers to issue EcoCredits of all types. Eco Labs is working directly with the Regen Registries team to make the process of learning how to start taking part in that process simple & clear within the Regen specific actions listed in The Impact App, as well as developing our own methodology, currently titled Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship.\n\ndMeter\nEco Labs is a founding organizational member of dMeter, where we are working to weave together dMRV techniques like human-sensing, sky-sensing, remote-sensing, and reputation-sensing as the low-cost, decentralized source of ground-truth used to issue and originate our Eco Credits. Leveraging the dMeter framework and ecosystem of partners will be key in our solutions.\n\nRegen League\nJan from Regen League has been working on a simple version of an on-boarding app to start mapping out regenerative projects, hubs, individual regenerators, and infrastructure platforms. This open database will provide a foundation for us to start building Regenerator on-boarding systems & user profiles that will be utilized in The Impact App.\n\nCommon Action / Myseelia\nCommon Action is an innovation network focused on accelerating climate and sustainability action, by connecting individuals and organizations with each other and to actionable knowledge and opportunities. The Common Action Ontology - MRV module will be developed as part of this project, to organize information about geographically-based impact needs, regenerative projects, and resource requirements. \n\nSilvi Protocol\nSilvi has been working on solving the human-sensing & tracking of tree planting using a mobile app. With the clear overlap in needs for human-sensing dMRV, Eco Labs & Silvi have partnered to build on top of the foundation of technology already developed, and use the Silvi app to perform human-sensing as part of the dMRV stack used to verify & originate Eco Credits. \n\nDigital Gaia,\nWe\u2019re working closely with Digital Gaia to apply our methodology within their active inference & digital twins system, so that our Eco Credits will have a Digital Gaia FERN score associated with them from the very beginning. This collaboration includes working on UI/UX tools for Regenerators, creating models for regenerative practices, and supporting each other as we try to solve the challenges of making regeneration an occupation. \n\nEco Art & Impact NFTs:\n\nEco Labs originated as a hub for collaborative, carbon negative NFT collections and ecological creativity. We're actively supporting and working with artists & creatives to inspire climate action, shape the narrative around regeneration, and help fundraise to support TIA development and compensate for regenerative practices once the platform is live. Here are some of our teams' current initiatives:\n\n1) The World After Us: Imaging techno-aesthetic futures is a traveling solo exhibition of sculptures, installations, prints, and photographs that combine plant life with electronic waste, and scientific experimentation with artistic exploration + Phoney Plants, an illustrated, cross-chain NFT collection based on this real world work\n\n2) Concerned Plant Society: a pfp project that is part of the ReFi NFT Coalition, ReFi Zone (a collaboration with ReFi Punks & Solar Sasquatch Squad)\n\n3) Dynamic NFT experiments - this year we hope to explore the ability to link an NFT directly to the regenerative projects it\u2019s associated with. More to come as we experiment with what\u2019s possible!\n",

    "projectDescription": "Silvi is helping build economic and coordination tools to contribute to the trillion tree target.\n \nWe believe the bulk of the solution is twofold:\n \n\ud83d\udcb0\u23f3 Upfront project funding via Tree-Commitments (We\u2019re calling it Tree Forwards) to incentivize and reward performance-based tree stewardship\n\ud83d\udccd\ud83d\udd2d Extreme traceability and attribution of new trees, not just for accountability and inventorying, but to unleash the community effects needed for tree-planting to become a thing!\n \nLet's unpack that \ud83d\udc46\n \nTree Forwards:\nSilvi is collateralizing the net present value of New Tree Forwards by locking commitment budgets into performance-based schedules that reward tree stewards as tree milestones are verifiably met. This is built at the unit-economic level but scales indefinitely. Because there are 50-60k tree species, Silvi is supporting a p2p library of species-specific methodologies. Think of it as DeSci tree wikis for tree science and intelligence and citizen science participatory model for the ground work/truth\n \nGround truth and MRV:\nOur focus has been on building a stack to serve the human-centric stages of the tree lifecycle while setting a strong and reliable decentralized science and open data foundation from which other Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) can happen. We're collaborating with dMeter and Regen Network on a Filecoin grant delivering a Claim Resolution Framework. Further, we'd like to collaborate and interop with other projects and technologies on techniques for statistical sampling of ground truth as well as remote sensing inference. And ultimately, we'd like to vertically integrate with carbon-certifying projects. \n \nInterface:\nSilvi is building an app where we're leveraging social media mechanics with citizen science frameworks to develop a Pokemon-Go-like experience for gamified tree planting and stewardship\n \nTokenomics:\nSilvi has finally started bringing its data on-chain via NFTs, IPFS. After that our long term plans involve launching a native governance token issued through tree commitments. Governance tokens will spawn utility NFT pairs that contain all the data and contracts for each tree, as well as the instructions on unique release schedules and requirements for commitment budgets based on tree type, location, timeline, relationships and stakeholders.\n\nPilots:\nTo date, Silvi has already deployed several pilots in the United States, including planting of 5 hardwood species and pines in a retired golf course while partnering with a conscious festival called Fire Flies Forest and experimenting with sapling distribution to homes and neighborhoods in Florida. Additionally, Silvi is partnering with EcoLabs and AgroforestDAO on the development of an adaptive agroforest methodology leveraging Silvi's Tree Forwards.\n\nSilvi's biggest focus is currently in Kenya, where it is connecting communities such as schools and small holder farmers to Kenya's last rainforest, Kakamega forest. The project aims to build a methodology to help establish small, distributed nursery beds around the forest with the goal of improving supply of saplings. With the help of Gitcoin funding, Silvi has established operations in a dozen schools and 8 small holder farmers and approaching 100k trees propagated from seed. The project is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries, Silvi is helping expand capacity of reforestation via its theory of change that a greater number of independent nurseries run by community members via a participatory model will help increase capacity and coordination. Silvi is close to being assigned an exclusive area for planting and forest management where our MRV and methodology will be put to the test over the following years.\n\nPartners:\nWe're so happy to be part of dMeter where other awesome dMRV projects like EcoLabs, Athena, Avano and Orgo are working together to solve planetary restoration and natural capital creation! We're partnering with Ecolabs and AgroForestDAO on the development of an agroforestry methodology and also a core member of dMRVNetwork, an MRV research group aimed at serving small holder farmers. We're also proud to be supported by Celo and the Climate Collective and incorporating Celo's stables for payouts in Kenya\n\nPlease reach out to us if you or anyone you know would like to be an early adopter of our tools and methodology towards hyperlocal reforestation ",

    "projectDescription": "Hey Solarpunk, stoked to have you here \ud83c\udf1e\n\nWe are building $Earth - First digital currency to be backed purely by climate solutions. Our goal is to -\n\n1. Mobilize over $ 5 Trillion/yr for the next 30 yrs to provide primary finance to projects in clean energy, regenerative agriculture, clean transport , ecosystem conservation and clean tech that will build the necessary infrastructure for a net zero world.\n2. Appropriately value natural ecosystems and their services while creating a monetary system that is backed by climate/ecology positive projects.\n3. Build the Solarpunk paradigm\n\n\n$Earth has been designed to make this happen by - \n\n1. Incentivizing users to purge their petro $$$ to mint $Earth directly at the protocol and use those $$$ to fund projects in renewables, permaculture, Ev charging stations, electric buses/trains , ecosystem conservation/regeneration, agroforestry, energy storage, clean tech etc\n2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world. $Earth acts as a unit of account for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate and the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc)\n3. Creating utility for $Earth by creating a network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth. \n\n\nThanks to your love and support during GR 15 we have been able to -\n\n1. Onboard developers and designers to help us build our website ( love to have some CRITICAL feedback) which is now live. \n2. Our tech team has also been successful in encoding $Earth tokenomics into smart contracts on which we have now conducted over 1750 test transactions. \n3. We have also onboarded 3 solar energy projects in India, Malawi and Nigeria that we are going to pilot with (details on website) and are in talks with 5 more projects in regenerative agriculture and EV space that we will onboard in the coming weeks. \n4. Take active part in hosting Refi India\n\n\nThis Alpha round Grant money will now be used for - \n\n1. Compliance/Legal for $Earth and Solarpunk Dao\n2. Hiring for Community Building and Credit Risk\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for all the love and support all yall Solarpunk shower on us. We are building strong in this bear and truly appreciate any contributions you can provide to make anthropogenic climate change history and make the solarpunk paradigm a reality.\n\n10 % of the fund raised will be allocated to projects working at the intersection of Refi x Rwa. List will be announced on twitter. ",

    "projectDescription": "THE CM GUILD\n\n-The Concept-\n\n\nThe CM Guild, or Community Managers Guild, was born out of the idea that community managers and the ReFi community could really benefit from having a similar experience to that of founders within the ReFi Dao Founders Circles. With this in mind we are building this hub within the ReFi Dao server alongside, and with the guidance of the ReFi Dao team. The intention is to be another service within ReFi Dao, with Community Managers and ReFi community building as the focal point.\n\nThe Community Managers Guild is focused on creating a central hub for Community Managers from ReFi specific projects, to come together. A place to learn, teach, collaborate, and grow together. It is designed to be a safe place to enhance, learn new skills, and make connections in the space. The idea is for those who take part in the guild will become better at growing the ReFi community at large. With new skills and tools to build and attract more individuals to the ReFi space, and thus grow the overall impact being made.\n\n-The Initial Structure-\n\nThe CM Guild will hold weekly workshops hosted by professionals in the space with an expertise in a variety of fields that are directly related with growing and engaging communities. There will also be product showcases where tools for community managing are shared. Representatives from those tool protocols will provide walk through training, demonstrations, and answer questions from Community Managers. All of these workshops will be recorded to create a library of educational content for future members to engage with.\n\n-The Near Future-\n\nLike the Founders Circles, the CM Guild will establish a cohort where circles are formed based on community type, location, phase of community development, and other factors. This will help ensure the greatest possible outcomes for the participating members. Each cohort will last between 6 to 8 weeks initially.\n\nWith the Community Managers Circles, fellow CMs will become more connected, and strengthen the overall ReFi community. The bonds created between fellow CMs during this time will carry beyond the cohort to further foster collaboration and community growth within the space. Cross pollinating and establishing a more connected tightly knit ReFi community overall.\n\nWe are also looking to create training courses utilizing a learn 2 earn platform, as well as providing access or memberships to paid for services which are beneficial to a Community Manager.\n\nThe training courses would offer a verifiable way for a community manager to prove they have completed a specific course and possess certain knowledge. This could be beneficial to future job prospects, or even current jobs.\n\nThese L2E courses will expose CMs to the experience of educational content on a platform that benefits the user. Together within the guild, members will have the opportunity to begin creating ReFi specific educational courses to be shared with fellow ReFi communities.\n\n\n-The Immediate Impact-\n\nOne of the initial public goods the CM Guild will make available immediately, is the Gitcoin Grants Give-A-Thon. This is something one of our team members had started with another organization, and has decided to bring to the CM Guild believing it would be a better fit.\n\n\nThe Give-A-Thon is a marathon Twitter Spaces for ReFi grantees that takes place during the Gitcoin Grants Round. It plays host to a number of co-hosts from large organizations who are looking to support grantees in the round. Projects are invited to sign up for 10 minute slots and present their work and how the grant will help them achieve their goals. The intention is to give these amazing projects the extra exposure to potential donors, and grow the community.\n\n-The Goal-\n\nOne thing that is certain, is that climate change is a global problem. The more people we can on-board to the ReFi space the greater the impact we can achieve. Community Managers play an integral role in growing, shaping, and engaging the very communities which will generate that impact.\n\nBy being a member of The CM Guild, Community Managers will have the opportunity to not only expand on their own knowledge and learn new skills, but help shape the entire ReFi community as a whole.\n\nIt makes sense that we invest in the people who are building these communities up.\n\n-Use of Funds-\n\nFunds from the grant will be directly deposited into a Multi-Sig for the following uses.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Operational costs, e.g. funding the Gitcoin Grants ReFi Give-A-Thon \n2\ufe0f\u20e3Creation of Learn 2 Earn courses designed for CMs as well as ReFi specific courses for the ReFi community\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Access to tools and materials for CMs\n4\ufe0f\u20e3A drip of funds to the communities that members represent, to be used specifically for community building events and campaigns to attract more individuals to the ReFi space\n\nFuture voting by well established members to determine best use of funds to help support and upskill Community Managers in the ReFi Space.",

    "projectDescription": "Treejer is an open protocol connecting donors to rural planters worldwide. The project leverages cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities in financing forest conservation and rural development.\n\nTreejer acts as a seamless, transparent bridge empowering local communities through crypto donations even in unbanked and remote areas. Treejer's approach incentivizes not only forest plantation but also conservation by locking up the funds in a smart contract and releasing it over time as planters and other data providers continue providing updates from forest status.\n\nThe protocol also provides proof-of-impact to donors in the form of dynamic tree NFTs that have real-world attributes. These NFTs are linked to each tree and are minted on Polygon network.\n\nTreejer protocol has several smart contracts and two main interfaces: a payment and forest tracking interface offered to donors on \"https://treejer.com\" and a dedicated mobile app for tree planters and rural ambassadors. They use it to submit new trees, provide updates and unlock conservation rewards.\n\nBesides using official interfaces, builders can integrate the tree planting plugin with their existing products.\n\n\ud83c\udf33 Product demo (v1):\nhttps://youtu.be/ZTcy-6IxT7U\n\n---=== The impact of QF donations ===---\nThis quadratic round will help us build the next iteration of Treejer protocol (v2.0) and expand the adoption of our current products.

    "projectDescription": "ABOUT\n \nMRV Foundation is a project that spun out of a founder\u2019s circle in the ReFi DAO. Effective measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of soil regeneration, crops\u2019 health improvement and biodiversity enhancement is critical to help small scale farmers and growers navigate tough challenges of climate change.\n \n \n \nTHE PROBLEM\n \nTraditional MRV approaches are prohibitively expensive, often constituting 30-40% of the costs of implementing regenerative practices for large projects over 1200 hectares. What\u2019s worse, these expenses are always upfront but the project developers are not able to receive revenues until the credits are sold after 5 years or longer. Additionally, the current MRV methodologies are analog, difficult to understand, very lengthy processes and often do not include regenerative practices valued by the local communities. Data gathered during traditional MRV practices is usually kept in silos and has no useful application or benefits for smaller farmers.\n \nSmall farmers produce ~85% of the world's food supply and they don\u2019t have any viable solutions and support to switch to regenerative practices. This scenario offers us a significant opportunity for regenerative impact. MRV is a key component of building a system that can drive financial means to small-scale projects. Not only in agriculture - forestry, ocean, city regeneration.\n\n\n\nOUR SOLUTION\n \nTo help small scale projects get full benefits of carbon, ecocredits and other incentives for ecosystem services, MRV Foundation is working to publish MRV101, an open source software-based guide to help small projects to quickly understand and implement relevant MRV best practices and reap the rewards. In the guide\u2019s first edition, we are starting with agriculture, agroforestry, and small-scale farming examples.\n \n \n \nDELIVERABLES (Each Phase lasting ~ 9-12 months)\n \nPhase 1: Understanding traditional MRV approaches (Completed with the help and support from Solid World Carbon Expert, Mr. Durga Prasad)\n \nPhase 2: Learning relevant MRV practices for Small Scale Projects in the context of pilot projects based in India. \n \nPhase 3: Combining our learnings with on-ground best practices and publishing the guide.\n \n \n \nGR15 UPDATE \n\nWe raised ~$45,000 in Gitcoin GR15. We are grateful for the Gitcoin Platform, the whole Gitcoin team and everyone who believed and supported us during GR15. Over the last three months, we have worked on the following:\n\n- We did meetings with the ReFi leaders to learn how to best utilize the funds for MRV research.\n- We welcomed a few open contributors to the core team for the agenda of research. \n- We organised deep-dive sessions with experts in the field of IOT, ReFi and Carbon Space to provide us with guidance during our weekly meetings.\n- We invited pilot projects to submit project proposals as per the guidelines set by Bati.\n- We received 5 pilot project pitches during the submission phase.\n- The leaders of these pilot projects were also acting as open contributors for our MRV research. Hence, unfortunately, the question of conflict of interest started to arise. These leaders were also busy leading their own individual projects and were not able to contribute fully as per the needs of the MRV Foundation. These factors slowed down our research efforts and therefore, we unfortunately had to fully restructure our research team in December.\n- For research, instead of relying on project leaders to act as open contributors, we have decided to partner with the agriculture scientists who are already doing research in the field of MRV. As the first step, we are partnering with Junagadh Agricultural University to engage with the academic researchers.\n- We are also in discussions with a few farmer collectives to get access to their farmlands for implementing pilot projects.\n\n\n\nUSAGE OF FUNDS FROM THIS ALPHA ROUND\n\n- Providing stipend to academic researchers and core contributors - 50%\n- Documentation of research - 20%\n- Providing for operational expenses of the foundation - 20%\n- Providing for legal and compliance expenses of the foundation - 5%\n- Towards strengthening ReFi Space in India to ReFiIndia - 5%\n\n\n \n \nIMPACT AREAS\n \n- Incentivise smallholder farmers for doing regenerative practices and MRV documentation.\n- Improve the scope of VCM to include Biodiversity and other forms of credits.\n- Increase citizen participatory methods in VCM, ReFi and climate action.\n- Build collaboration with the DeSci community.\n- Bring existing MRV tools for the application in small scale projects.\n- Develop new tools where gaps are identified.\n\nCORE TEAM\n\n- Bhavesh Bati (https://twitter.com/Bati_ReFi)\n- Priyank Bakshi (https://twitter.com/0xClimate)\n",

    "projectDescription": "What is Hibiscus DAO?\n\nHibiscus DAO is building the first transparent, open-source, community-owned toolkit for the fashion creator economy.\n\nWe want to return power + ownership to creators and producers - and eliminate negative human rights and environmental externalities from the fashion supply chain.\n\nWHY?\n\nCurrent Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation\n\nThe apparel and luxury market is growing exponentially: reaching $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.\n\nBut the industry's success is rooted in exploitation. Its business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.\n\nTraditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation\n\nSlave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands.\n\nThese human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR. \n\nTraditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation\n\nTalented young designers generate massive value for brands - often with little to no compensation.\n\nA successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.\n\nTraditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation\n\nFashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit. \n\nWhen overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.\n\nWe\u2019re a **black-led** team and here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on:\n\nEnabling Profit Redistribution + Transparent Supply Chain + Community Ownership = Human Rights Impact\n\nHibiscus recently created the first ever on-chain profit redistribution contract for garment production - redistributing profits from FWB merch sales to supply chain participants.\n\nHibiscus is looking to build on this by onboarding sewers, pattern makers, printers & other workers from the garment industry who are \"stuck\" working for a factory with no access to profit redistribution - giving them ownership over the value they create.\n\nBuilding cryptographic profit sharing into our tooling enables the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel. \n\nCrypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders:\n\n- Community owned ateliers vs. factories and manufacturers.\n- Fork-able concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.\n- Designs registered as on-chain vectors - enabling proper credit and compensation.\n- Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community.\n- Locally accessible physical design and fashion resources.\n\nBuilding a Transparent Supply Chain\n\nCreating open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.\n\nCreating \u201cProof of Ethical Production\u201d + Oracles\n\nEventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.\n\nFighting Fast Fashion = Environmental Impact\n\nAs a part of our stack - we are working on the first solution for holding fast-fashion polluters accountable.\n\nSince the last Gitcoin grants round, we\u2019ve created the first model for on-chain profit redistribution in fashion - successfully experimented with the on-chain profit redistribution to stakeholders who previously had no access to upside from their IP. We\u2019re almost ready to drop a case study - open-sourcing the process behind this historic collection.\n\nNow we want to enable supply chain provenance and environmental transparency in the garment production process: create and test the first functional model for an open-source apparel supply chain to show how the garments were produced and the corresponding environmental impacts. \n\nSupply Chain Accountability\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? \n\nNow that we\u2019ve experimented with profit redistribution - we want to run experiments to figure out how to capture garment production metadata on chain.\n\nAnd after that - putting these new data capture + manufacturing processes into practice by experimenting with a garment collection that incorporates provenance and accountability around environmental impacts of the collection.\n\nWe hope that our efforts will set precedent and can serve as a model for future apparel projects. The current landscape of crypto fashion is \u201cmerch\u201d that encourages wasteful consumption, enablement of existing exploitative power structures, and no regard for the environmental impacts.\n\nHibiscus seeks to change that by providing an alternative approach that enables sustainability which already reduces waste or gives accountability around environmental impacts of garment production.\n\nOpen-Sourcing a Model for Ethical Clothing Production\n\nThis experiment will inform the development of environmental oracles that will allow any apparel project to open-source their environmental impact and adopt new environmental standards - all done via leveraging supply chain metadata arising through the garment production process. \n\nThis supply chain experiment will be done with local supply chain participants in Toronto, Canada - with the hope of subsequently expanding out into other countries. \n\nHibiscus is creating and open sourcing the first model for a decentralized, transparent supply chain in fashion. \n\nHow = Utilizing L2s for Real-World Crypto Use Cases\n\nBlockchain technology is often criticized by naysayers as not having real-world uses. \n\nHibiscus\u2019 goal of creating an open-source, community-owned supply chain is one of the strongest examples of an IRL use case for crypto. \n\nIn order to create a truly sustainable, community-owned supply chain for clothing, Hibiscus needs to focus heavily on grassroots community work - onboarding sewers, pattern makers, textile producers, and other supply chain participants.\n\nIn many cases - these supply chain participants are members of underrepresented groups: people of color without much exposure to technology - who would be vulnerable to exploitation by traditional fashion industry structures and institutions.\n\nThese participants in the garment supply chain have never heard of blockchain before.  \n\nOnboarding them onto Ethereum mainnet -  and having them pay anywhere from a few dollars  to a few hundred dollars in gas fees - is simply not feasible for this demographic.\n\nInstead we will work directly with these local supply chain participants to onboard them into crypto via L2s - which can provide an accessible, feasible entry point to these new ecosystem participants. \n\nWe hope to use L2 infrastructure as foundational substrates to build real world utility and onboard new non-crypto native users.\n\nWe will open-source this process to create onboarding resources and serve as a model to other projects who are building real world use cases on L2s - to help accelerate driving real-world adoption.\n\nWhat\u2019s next on the roadmap?\n\nWe\u2019ve hit our short term goal to use liquid 0xSplits to experiment with redistribution contracts for primary sales for garment workers since the last Gitcoin grants round.\n\nWe seek to build on this success by creating garments made using a transparent supply chain by open sourcing garment production metadata - proving out our model for supply chain accountability.\n\nThrough this process - we will onboard underrepresented communities onto Ethereum L2.\n\nAs mentioned above - we\u2019re working towards a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically, without negative human rights and environmental externalities. \n\nWith an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.\n\nFor a deeper dive into our ecosystem, we invite you to read the first edition of our whitepaper linked on our website: hibiscus.tech.

So we've been forced to rely on governments and big companies. \n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udc79  THE ANGRY TEENAGERS ARE ANGRY ABOUT THIS  \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\n\nNow we've channeled that anger and used to blockchain to build a solution. \n\nWe've created Angry Teenager tokens that each hold a vote in a DAO. The funds raised from selling tokens goes into the DAO wallet, and then they vote to release funds to plant trees in the real world. \n\nThis has involved innovation not only in the smart contracts that manage the DAO (check our white paper for more details on \"opt-out voting etc), but also in real world legal contracts \ud83d\udc73\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. All of that work is open sourced, of course. \n\nEach token is geo-located to a specific square within the project \ud83e\udde9. So buyers can see exactly where their money is going, and the piece of land that they have reforested. They can also watch \ud83d\udd2d the trees grow over time because the tokens regularly and dynamically update with photos and other data. \n\n\ud83d\udc63EARNING CARBON CREDITS\ud83d\udc63\nAs the trees grow, token holders earn carbon offsets which they can use to offset their carbon footprint. You can have 100% transparency and so 100% confidence in the work that is creating your carbon offsets. \n\n\ud83d\udcb0THE VALUE PROPOSITION\ud83d\udcb0\n=> Individuals and small companies can now fund the creation of a forest on a specific square of land in Africa, starting with investments as low as $150. \n\n=> They can watch that forest grow, and share photos and other media about the project with their customers and friends. \n\n=> They earn super high quality carbon credits that they can use to offset their carbon footprint. \n\n=> If Ever they want to stop earning carbon credits, they can sell their token on the open market - if the price of carbon credits has risen, this might even make them a profit :)\n\n********************UPDATES SINCE GR-15******************\n\n=> Smart Contracts fully audited\n=> Artwork. Beautiful artwork is complete. \n=> $10k Pre-Sale tokens sold to raise funding for the first test planting on 2 hectares. \n=> Verra Project Design Document 90% done. This allows us to generate Verra-authenticated carbon credits which have the highest value. \n\n********************END TRANSMISSION********************\n\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34",

    "projectDescription": "Introduction\n\n\nBorn from Carbon DAO, The Aetlas Protocol is a ReFi protocol that is designed to connect the ReFi ecosystem and unlock new inflows of green capital. We designed a liquidity and retirement mechanism that offer the best of both a liquidity pool and an NFT marketplace. This offers the ReFi ecosystem a liquid marketplace that retains the unique values offered by each individual carbon project.\n\n\nWho\u2019s this for and what are their problems?\n\n\nThere are five types of users in the Aetlas Protocol:\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Project Developers: \nA user who manages a carbon sequestration or emission reduction project issuing carbon credits on a supported on-chain carbon offset registry. Their main objective is to sell the carbon assets they created. Their considerations are a balance between time to sell and price per carbon metric tonne. With greater liquidity in a carbon market, comes a significant reduction in time to market. However, liquidity focused markets often mean the project developer sacrifices any additional value of their individual project.\n\n\n\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffd Carbon Traders: \nA users that buy and sell carbon assets for profit. They often look for opportune assets to buy and supply willing buyers who don\u2019t have the time to search themselves. The problem they face with existing pools is the additional fee they incur (up to 10%) for withdrawing carbon assets from liquidity pools. This reduces the number viability arbitrage trades which creates a less efficient market and creates barriers for new inflows of green capital.\n\n\n\u2747\ufe0f Liquidity Providers: \nA user looking to capitalise on 15x expected increase in demand for carbon in the next 7 years. They are users who hold carbon assets and who provides liquidity to the ReFi ecosystem. The problem they face is that carbon is a depreciating asset. An 2005 carbon credit is worth less than an identical 2020 carbon credit.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddfa Offset Funders: \nThis is a protocol or community who funds offsetting of the carbon emissions their users generate. The barrier for funders is the technical requirements, sustainability expertise and co-ordination to design an effective on-chain carbon portfolio.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddcdOffset Curators: \nThis can be an individual user or a sustainability focused DAO. They often have the time and sustainability expertise but lack the funds to execute their vision for a greener tomorrow.\n\nAetlas Protocol solves these dilemma by separating the retirement and carbon portfolio curation process from the transaction of funds. We have designed a series of deployable autonomous liquidity pools interconnected with a carbon NFT marketplace and powered by a carbon offset funding mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Project Developers will have access to instant liquidity for their carbon assets but will be able to monetise their additional value post-sale. This is achieved by a Dutch auction held by the liquidity pool for all newly deposited carbon assets.\n\n\n\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffd Carbon Traders benefit from zero % fees for withdrawing carbon from liquidity pools.\n\n\n\u2747\ufe0f Liquidity Providers have minimised exposure to the depreciation of individual carbon assets with a liquidity pool acting as a carbon index that actually generates a yield from the retirement of sold assets. The healthy connection between the NFT marketplace and liquidity pools also helps prevent stagnation older assets.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddfa Offset Funders are unlocked with an incredibly simple funding mechanism. It can be deployed as simply as \u201cSend X USDC to this address + a list of wallets who will curate your portfolio\u201d or the funding process can be integrated at a transactional level within the smart contracts.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddcd Offset Curators are empowered by the funding mechanism to design and implement any variety of impact investment strategy.\n\n\n\nThe Technicals:\n\n\nFunctions - Instance of the Tokenized Vault Contract\n\n\nDeposit Function: This function allows traders to deposit TCO2e tokens into the tokenized vault contract. The function first checks that the receiver's token is held by the smart contract, and that the sender has approved the contract to transfer their tokens. It then checks that the sender's tokens meets the pre-determined selection criteria using a function called isValidTCO2e. Upon depositing a TCO2e tokens, the function then calculates, mints and transfers the appropriate amount of xCLP to the sender using a function called calculateXCLP and the mintXCLP function. xCLP represents a percentage ownership of the underlying assets held in the smart contract. If the TCO2e token does not meet the criteria, the function will reject the tokens and return it to the user.\n\n\nWithdraw Function: This function allows users to withdraw TCO2e tokens from the contract by burning a corresponding amount of xCLP in the users wallet. The function should check that the user has sufficient xCLP and that the requested token is held by the contract. If these conditions are met, the function should burn the xCLP and transfer the requested TCO2e tokens to the user.\nRetrieveTCO2e Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the TCO2e tokens held by the tokenized vault contract.\n\n\nSwap Function: This function allows a user to swap a TCO2e tokens that is not held by the tokenized vault contract but meets the tokenized vault's pre-determined selection criteria with a TCO2e tokens that is already deposited and held by the tokenized vault contract. The function takes three arguments: the address of the sender (the trader who is sending their TCO2e tokens), the ID of the sender's TCO2e tokens, and the ID of the receiver's TCO2e tokens (the TCO2e tokens already deposited in the tokenized vault contract). The function first checks that the receiver's token is held by the smart contract, and that the sender has approved the contract to transfer their tokens. It then checks that the sender's tokens meets the pre-determined selection criteria using a function called isValidTCO2e. If these checks pass, the sender's TCO2e token is transferred to the smart contract, and the receiver's token is transferred to the sender.\n\n\nisValidTCO2e Function: This function checks that a TCO2e token meets the pre-determined selection criteria for the tokenized vault. It takes a single argument: the ID of the TCO2e tokens. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the token meets the criteria or not.\ncalculateXCLP Function: This function calculates the appropriate amount of xCLP to be minted or burnt when a TCO2e token is deposited or exchanged in the tokenized vault. It takes a two argument: the ID\u2019s of the TCO2e tokens and the quantity of each. The function returns a uint256 value representing the amount of xCLP to be minted or burnt.\n\n\nmintXCLP Function: This an internal function mints xCLP for a given wallet address. It takes two arguments: the address of the wallet and the amount of xCLP to be minted. The function updates the total supply of xCLP and the balance for the specified wallet address. The amount of xCLP minted is must be restricted to a 1:1 ratio with the deposited number of TCO2e tokens.\n\n\nFunctions - Instance of the Treasury Pool Contracts:\nFundOffsetUSDC Function: This function allows users to deposit USDC into the contract. Upon deposit, the function mints the ERC20 token OFT (Offset Funding Token) with a 1:1 ratio to USDC deposited and proportionally distributes it to a list of wallet addresses provided by the user. The USDC is then added to the contract's funds, dedicated to purchasing TCO2e tokens from any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract.\n\n\nFundOffsetERC20 Function: This function allows users to deposit any ERC20 with a corresponding Uniswap USDC pair ****into the contract. Upon deposit, the function swaps the ERC20 token for USDC using the correct Uniswap pair. After USDC is depoisted into the function mints the ERC20 token OFT (Offset Funding Token) with a 1:1 ratio to USDC deposited and proportionally distributes it to a list of wallet addresses provided by the user. The USDC is then added to the contract's funds, dedicated to purchasing TCO2e tokens from any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract.\nRetire Function: This function allows users who received OFT to retire specific TCO2e tokens held by any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract. The calculateXCLP function in the relevant instances of the Tokenised Vault contract holding the specified TCO2e tokens is called to retrieve an array including each xCLP and the corresponding amount required for the transaction.The calculateUSDC function is called for the array of xCLP required returning value for the requiredUSDC. The OFT equal to requiredUSDC is transferred from the user to the Treasury Pool Contract. The swap function on the UniSwap USDC/xCLP pool contract is called to exchange the USDC for a corresponding amounts of each xCLP. The function should then call the **Withdraw** function of the relevant instances of the Tokenized Vault Contract to exchange the xCLP for a specific TCO2e token held by the contract. After the exchange is complete, the function should burn the OFT and route the TCO2e tokens through the Retirement aggregator contract.\n\n\ncalculateUSDC Function: This function calculates the appropriate amount of USDC required to swap for a list of xCLP variants.It takes a two argument: the ID\u2019s of the xCLP tokens and the quantity of each.The function calls the quoteExactOutputSingle function in the Uniswap USDC/xCLP pool returns a uint256 value representing the amount of USDC required for the swap.RetrieveTotalFunding Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a uint256 value for the total amount of USDC deposited.\n\n\nOther functions:\n\nRetrieveSourceOfFunding Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the total amount of USDC deposited by each corresponding address (AKA funder).\n\n\nRetrieveFunderContribution Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a value for the total amount of USDC deposited by a specific address (AKA funder).\n\n\nRetrieveTotalRetirement Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a uint256 value for the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired.\n\n\nRetrieveCurators Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired by each corresponding address (AKA curators).\n\n\nRetrieveFunderContribution Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a value for the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired by a specific address (AKA curators).\n",

    "projectDescription": "\u2757Problem Statement\n \nThe financial and political incentives to fight climate change, soil degradation and systemic degeneration are insufficient to mitigate and reverse the risks we face as humanity.\n\n\ud83d\udcc3Our Proposal\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Why?\nToday, most commercial seeds available in the market are bound to intellectual property rights \u2013 the majority being owned by an oligopoly that is slowly becoming the owner of our food chain. \n\n\ud83d\udfe2What?\nHemp is an ancient plant that has been used for around 10.000 years, and one of our most powerful instruments for producing positive socio-ecological impacts. It has an extensive application range in various industries such as food, textile, construction and many more.\nDespite such functionality, the highly centralized ownership structure makes it harder to experiment with hemp and adopt sustainable & regenerative business practices with it.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2How?\n\ud83c\udf31Earthist considers heirloom seeds as public goods. We aim to protect nature\u2019s legacy and transfer it to future generations without degeneration. We work for sustainable land regeneration at scale through hemp farming and aim to incentivize small/family farmers to adopt decentralized MRV technologies for positive ecological impact while producing carbon-conscious raw materials.\n \n\ud83e\ude84Since GR 13:\n\u2705We have found and collected four different types of lost heirloom cannabis seeds from across the country and have safely stored them in our seed bank.\n\u2705Over 6.250.000 seeds were successfully planted and harvested by farmers in five different regions through our network.\n\u2705We have given away 70% of our hemp seed related products as a gift to the community in order to improve health and raise awareness about regenerative hemp farming and heirloom seeds.\n\u2705Collaborating with amazing climate projects such as dMRV Network, Atlantis and Digital Gaia (Augmented collective intelligence to integrate real-world data with natural models to continuously evaluate real global impact, using seeds as an ancient tool for cybernetic communication)\n\ud83c\udf31We\u2019ve invested in mechanization and bought a hemp seed dehulling machine to make the first local hemp hearts from heirloom seeds. \n\ud83c\udf31 We have opened a Gitcoin community-supported \"Everything-Hemp-Store\" in Istanbul \ud83d\udc9a Thanks to this, we will also have a small space for 9-10 people to host hemp and regeneration-related workshops.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fNext\nGitcoin Alpha Round \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThe number of local farmers in the country by the end of 2021 was 512.000 as opposed to 1.122.000 in 2011. Moreover, with inadequate political and economic decisions given by the government, inflation rates in the country have risen to 181%. \nThere is a bottleneck between farmers and the market as a result of the lack of investment and equipment in our sector.\nAs Earthists: \n\ud83d\udfe2We have to be the market makers, farmers, producers, subject experts and consciousness changers all at the same time. This is not an easy task though!\nNow, \n\ud83d\udfe2We need to improve our machinery to accelerate the production of hemp goods. In this way, we can show the proven value and amazing potential of the nonpsychoactive variety of the cannabis plant with more than 96 different hemp-based products. All made by Earthists for health, cosmetics, textile, paper, construction etc.\n\ud83d\udfe2This is an amazing opportunity to show people that they can eat it, drink it, read it, tie it, wear it and live in it all while rapidly generating the soil and protecting the climate with your support! \n\ud83d\udc9cHemp is hope and a vital part of the solution to today\u2019s problems!\nThank you for your support.\n\nAll previous Gitcoin round supporters are invited to the store to pick up a free Earthist Garden Hemp Seed Oil by displaying their POAP!\n",

The current systems of banking, finance, carbon markets, nature based solutions, and conservation are inadequate to serve planetary regeneration. \nBlockchain technology enables collaboration at scale, decentralized governance, and crowdsourced financial models to Climate Action. \n\nMost of this ReFi activity is concentrated in the global North.\n\nOur aim is to accelerate\n1. Education around Climate and Blockchain. \ud83d\udcd6\n2. Project discovery, Funding, and scaling. \ud83d\udcc8\n3.Supporting Proof of Concept's as well as\n4. Enabling \"interoperability\" conversations around Language, code, tokens and regulation.\ud83e\udd1d\n\n\ud83c\udf32\n\nPast work\nOver last year; we have been actively surfacing the global south across ReFi conversations in the ecosystem - supporting projects, individuals, and initiatives.\n\nSeptember 2022\nSupporting Founders in ReFi DAO with grant applications and a marketing guide in conjunction with ReFi DAO\n\nOctober 2022 \nLOA Labs organized the Greenhouse retreat under the BICOWG aegis with active participation from the global South\n\nNovember 2022\nIndia\u2019s first ReFi summit with active participation of Climate changemakers, ReFi Projects, Founders, Investors and Developers.\n\nDecember 2022\nGrants Roundtable with Gitcoin, Polygon, Celo, Climate Collective, Solana Foundation, Regen Foundation and Hbar Foundation. \n\nReFi Gratitude NFT collection\n\nTwitter spaces in local languages across Nigeria, Singapore, and India\n\n\ud83c\udf32\n\nOver the course of the year; we have supported projects across Australia, Japan, Abu Dhabi, Africa, and South America.\n\nIn order to bring this global need to local action, we need to leapfrog communities onto Web3.\n\n\ud83c\udf32\n\nGoing Forward.\nThe proceeds from this grant round would go towards\n\n1. Educating Climate(mitigation, adaptation, and offset) projects around leveraging tech(Web3) to scale MRV, project funding, market access, and interoperability\n2. ReFi Gokarna - India\u2019s first ReFi Hackathon at a biodiversity hotspot.\n3. ReFi Ambassadors across Singapore, India, Nigeria, Uganda and more\n4. Roundtables with Regen Investors and around raising Grants\n5. Documenting Climate(+  impact) blockchain projects as use cases for local Industry( and Regulatory ) engagement.\n6.

    "projectDescription": "A full-featured native iOS/macOS library that provides Web3 functionality in Swift with native ABI parsing and smart contract interactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nWe are working on a universal library that provides web3 functionalities in Swift language so that developers can build full-featured native dApps on the Mac/iOS ecosystem. \n\nDevelopers can find out-of-box functionalities that they usually need in our library, such as web3 web view kit, ABI parsing and decoding, smart contract interactions, etc. Moreover, since Swift allows compilation to WebAssembly, the library also supports WebAssembly. This allows iOS/MacOS developers to work in their native interfaces. As a result, the library greatly improves developer productivity, and helps fulfill the vision of decentralized applications.\n\nThere are several other open-source projects in the field of web3swift, such as [Web3 (0.4.1)](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift), [Web3Swift.io](https://github.com/zeriontech/Web3Swift), [web3swift.pod](https://github.com/bankex/web3swift), etc. But in terms of the technologies adopted, our library is yet the most advanced one tha\u3119 most of them, since we have full support of such features as **TxPool, ENS, event loops, etc**. Our library is therefore more widely used by the community.\n\n\nWe provide the community with **convenient tools** to work with Ethereum blockchain in Swift. Developers can therefore attain the ability to **quickly create secure decentralized applications** for Apple devices, without studying cryptography beforehand. This allows developers to focus on the content quality and UX/UI in DApps, which in turn **increases the adoption** of Ethereum blockchain and facilitates community growth.\n\nThe library was an essential part in several winning projects at ETHBerlin2018 and ETHDenver2019. We made it possible to work with Ethereum from mobile devices. Nowdays, our library is one of the most used iOS/MacOS libraries for Ethereum, and it was used in almost all ETH-related hackhathons.\n\nOur project is in great demand, more than 10 dApps have been using our [codes in production](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift#projects-that-are-using-web3swift), such as [Loopring](https://github.com/Loopring/loopr-ios?files=1), [PeepETH](https://github.com/matter-labs/PeepethClient), [ENSWallet](https://github.com/barrasso/enswallet), and many others. We have [more than 1000 references](https://github.com/search?p=4&amp;q=pod+%27web3swift%27&amp;type=Code) in GitHub.\n\nAs the library is so popular, our users also keep pushing for updates. There are  [several new features requests (25 open issues for now)](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/issues). But since this is the team's open-source side project, we can&#39;t spend the money we raised with Matter Labs to support it, especially when it&#39;s unrelated to the main goal of Matter Labs: To scale Ethereum.\n\nWe already put in a vast amount of work to support the most used functionalities, including the following:\n\n- \u26a1 Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality\n- \ud83d\udcad Interaction with remote node via **JSON RPC**\n- \ud83d\udd10 Local **keystore management** (geth compatible)\n- \ud83e\udd16 Smart-contract **ABI parsing**\n- \ud83d\udd13 **ABI deconding** (V2 is supported with return of structures from public functions. Part of 0.4.22 Solidity compiler)\n- \ud83d\udd78 **(ENS) support** - a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Smart contracts interactions** (read/write)\n- \u26e9 **Infura support** , partial Websockets API support\n- \u2692 **Parsing TxPool** content into native values (ethereum addresses and transactions) - easy to get pending transactions\n- \ud83d\udd87 **Event loops** functionality\n- \ud83d\udcf1 Supports Web3View functionality (WKWebView with **injected &quot;web3&quot; provider** )\n- \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Possibility to **add or remove &quot;middleware&quot; that intercepts** , modifies and even **cancel transaction** workflow on stages \"before assembly\", \"after assembly\"and \"before submission\"\n- \u2705 **Literally following the standards** (BIP, EIP, etc):\n\n    - [**BIP32**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) **(HD Wallets),**[**BIP39**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) **(Seed phrases),**[**BIP44**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) **(Key generation prefixes)**\n  - [**EIP-20**](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) (Standart interface for tokens - ERC-20), [**EIP-67**](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/67) (Standard URI scheme), [**EIP-155**](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) (Replay attacks protection)\n\n    - **And many others** _(For details about this EIP&#39;s look at [Documentation page](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/blob/master/Documentation/))_: EIP-681, EIP-721, EIP-165, EIP-777, EIP-820, EIP-888, EIP-1400, EIP-1410, EIP-1594, EIP-1643, EIP-1644, EIP-1633, EIP-721, EIP-1155, EIP-1376\n- \ud83d\udddc **Batched requests** in concurrent mode\n\n- **RLP encoding** Base58 encoding scheme support\n",

    "projectDescription": "ECHO is the first decentralized social engagement protocol based on Arweave. \n\nOur goal is to provide the fundamental infrastructure of Web3 social by introducing the first comment widget that can be deployed on any Web3 website with permanent data storage, so that users can speak up for themselves in a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant environment. It is our conviction that every person deserves to be heard, and we strive to create the right tool to make that happen. \u201cLong live our opinion\u201d, as our slogan goes.\n\nMore importantly, as we are providing a multi-chain, multi-platform, and multi-disciplinary solution, ECHO will energize the social mobility in an aggregated manner to address the current social segregation issue in Web3. And our protocol-based data structure of social activities both on-chain and off-chain will be the cornerstone of the future Web3 social paradigm.\n\nOur opinion is our intellectual assets. People don\u2019t own their voice in Web2, and people have no tool to own their voice in Web3. People are awakening that decentralization should not be limited to finance, but also in other fields. And we need a product so that people can speak freely and equally without worrying about censorship and privacy issue. And Arweave is a much better storage solution than IPFS that the technology is mature to make this happen. \n\nECHO provides a neutral commenting tool that can be used to comment on anything, including Gitcoin grants.\n\nWe have established partnerships with companies and products such as Arweave, .bit, everPay, Mirror, Mail3.me and permaFacts.\n",

    "projectDescription": "What are Optinames?\n\nOptinames are tradable and transferable sub-domains wrapped as ERC721s & fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on L1 Ethereum by utilizing an off-chain resolver.\n\nImportant Links:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/stevegachau/optimismresolver\n\nOff-chain Resolver on L1 - https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain NFTs on Optimism - https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain Example on ENS App - https://app.ens.domains/name/nick.ecc.eth/details\n\nSubdomain Example on Etherscan - https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Rainbow Wallet - https://rainbow.me/nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Opensea - https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x9fb848300E736075eD568147259bF8a8eeFe4fEf/2\n\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nThis project is leading the charge in making it easier & cheaper to acquire and utilize ens domains. We are implementing the latest technologies released by the ENS team (CCIP Read & Off-chain resolution) to make it possible for users to register subdomains on Optimism while making them available & resolvable on L1 Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to providing free ENS subdomain on Optimism (currently ecc.eth), OptiNames is partnering with NFT projects & gaming communities building their games on any Layer 2. These communities will be utilizing our tech and smart contracts to provide free usernames & gamer-tags that double up as ENS subdomains.\n\nAdoption:\n\nThe first project utilizing Optinames to issue subdomains to their community is ECC Name Service. ECC Name Service has since grown to become the Number 1 domain collection on Optimism.\n\nRegistrations: 17,725\n\nWhat Next?: Optinames is working on and will soon be launching ENS Wildcards on L2\n\nMany NFT communities on Ethereum and L2s have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, requiring each NFT holder to manually register an ENS subdomain can be cumbersome. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names.\n\nWildcard subdomains offer a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder to receive an ENS name automatically at no cost & without any registration step. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (linked to an NFTs token ID) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection.\n",

    "projectDescription": "Inspiration\nWhen we say that an Ethereum account has been lost, it refers to two cases:\n\nThe owner forgets the private key, which means the assets are permanently lost.\nThe owner leaks the private key, which means anyone with the private key can act the same as the original account owner.\nOur project aims to protect account owners of the latter case, which is very dangerous: the account owner loses the exclusive right to use the account, which indicates the account is not secure anymore.\n\nFor leaked accounts, DApps should be aware of them on time to protect the original owners of these accounts. For example, when one reports that her account is leaked:\n\nMulti-signature wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe) should ban this account.\nWeb3 email providers (e.g., MetaMail) in which users log in with signatures should suspend everybody's access to emails of this account to protect the privacy of the original owner.\nElectronic agreements based on ETH accounts (e.g., ETHSign) should disqualify this account from signing new agreements. Because the new agreements signed may not be authorized by the original owner.\nTo solve the above problems, we propose the 0xdeadlist.io project to maintain a list of addresses whose private keys have been leaked. By rewarding the burier NFT (Non-fungible token), 0xDeadList encourages users and hackers to report accounts with leaked private keys, and stores the information of these leaked accounts on the chain to facilitate DApps project parties to query these insecure accounts.\n\nWhat it does\n0xDeadList is a public good that encourages users to collect and report addresses whose private keys are leaked. Users can directly log in to 0xdeadlist.io to report the leaked address. The main contract of 0xDeadList provides two steps (lock address and bury address) to report leaked addresses under the following considerations:\n\nPreventing the reporter's NFT reward from being stolen by front-running attacks.\nEnsuring the reporter has enough time before the private key of the leaked address is fully disclosed.\nIn step 1, the reporter locks the address to be buried, and the contract records the address of the reporter. At this time, the private key of the locked address will not be disclosed.\n\nIn step 2, the user uploads the private key of the locked address in step 1, and the reporter address recorded in the contract will receive an NFT reward, indicating that the address is buried, and the buried (or say, leaked) address will receive a tombstone SBT (Soul Bound Token), which is not transferable. In step 2, the private key of the buried address will be made public (recorded on-chain), ensuring the leaked address is indeed leaked.\n\nThe 0xDeadList project is fully open-sourced, and here are some resources:\n\nWebsite: https://0xdeadlist.io\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/0xDeadList\n\nContracts: 0x59451a98d772f2a53ca2241a884b1703f8c55218",

    "projectDescription": "Some of you already know us from around the \u2018decentralized\u2019 block. Jolocom has been supporting and driving the mission of Self-sovereign Identity since 2014. We are a founding member of DWeb, INATBA, Bundesblock and also long-time supporters and active members of DIF, the IIW and W3C. We joined the Gitcoin-Community in early 2022, together with our friends from DWeb and the Internet Archive. \n\n \n\nJolocom is committed to upholding the principles of SSI and has developed a fully open-source tech stack to that end, consisting of a library, an SDK and Smart Wallet for end users. During the infancy of digital identity, this has brought us to the forefront of development houses in Germany and Europe and also to the attention of regulators and lawmakers. Among other things, we are the chosen tech providers in three quarters of the German government\u2019s Secure Digital Identity showcase projects.\n\nNow, though, we are seeing the mature phase of digital identity approaching: by end of 2023, every EU citizen will be asked to hold an \"identity wallet.\" But will that identity be Self-Sovereign? In other words, will citizens and users finally be in control of their own identity data or will it be under the control of a monopolistic centralized authorities or oligopolistic federated actors?\n\n \n\nFor Jolocom to continue building open source, not-for-profit SSI solutions, as we have for the last eight years, and to further establish EU and global standards for interoperability in decentralized identity, we need to scale at the same speed as the growing market. And here we need your help. \n\n \n\nIn the aforementioned Secure Digital Identity (SDI) Projects of the German government we are building out the Jolocom SmartWallet to integrate different government services, bridge between different services and industry actors via the Jolocom Issuer and Verifier Agent, while also partnering with researchers and experts to prepare a UI/UX design ready for mass adoption.

    "projectDescription": "talentDAO is a community of digital vagabonds, deranged scientists, and renegade internet natives, passionate about DAOs and the future of work. We believe DAOs can provide a path forward where knowledge is decentralized and talent is unlocked for the betterment of society. \n \nThere\u2019s just one problem: The science of DAOs is yet to be known; it must be explored. It must be learned. Traditional scientific settings are largely broken due to outdated institutional norms, obsolete academic infrastructure, and inefficient funding models. So without hesitation, a team of researchers has taken the plunge down the Web3 rabbit hole to find a new solution. \n Our focus is on building coordination software for the future of work, conducting applied research experiments with DAOs, and perpetuating decentralized work culture through art, media, education, and events.\n\nAt talentDAO we are studying layer zero and building human coordination experiments so that we might all benefit. In simplest terms, we are using science to fix DAOs and DAOs to fix science. To do this well will only be possible if science is given an infrastructure and culture upgrade. This is where we come in. \n\nZooming out\n\n \n\nDAOs create opportunities for global impact. Human coordination structures of this scale have never been available to solve challenges in scientific innovation until now. Over the next 20 years entire communities of scientists will organize using DAO structures. A digital nation of scientists operating as a DAO will dramatically improve the probability of achieving important sustainability goals mandated by the United Nations. We focus on four of them. \n\n \n\nGoal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\n\nEveryone should have access to decentralized working arrangements. To see that through, we\u2019re building the foundations required for a decentralized work economy starting with the talentDAO community. Our goal is to have the majority of members who wish to be bankless and self-sovereign workers a reality by 2030. Everyone should have the right to decent work, free from affliction and labor exploitation.\n \n\nGoal 9: Build infrastructure and foster innovation\n\nThe traditional academic process has stifled innovation. The scientific record of knowledge is vulnerable to the risks of centralized Web2 storage. TalentDAO is building all of its research on a completely decentralized publication that is censorship resistant, immutable, and safely secured on Arweave. We are fostering innovation by allowing for a bottom up approach to research by creating an open social graph of scientists built on Lens Protocol. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal 10: Reduce Inequality\n\nEnsuring funding and educational resources are provided to all students across the world, not just the weird ones. Contributing to open source research that is accessible to all and with no paywall required. Traditional research publications systematically discriminate against students with less access to education resources. \n \n\nGoal 11: Sustainable cities and communities\n\n \n\nIn the future DAOs will be sovereign digital nations. At talentDAO, we aspire to create a Network State of interdisciplinary educational institutes, providing high quality education and research to all parts of the world, not just the privileged. We cannot go at this alone. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve teamed up with groups such as CityDAO and Sapien Network to scale together.\n\n\nWhat we are building\n\n \n\nWeb3 solutions for scientific peer review, funding, and publication. Making it easy for any education program to launch a journal and sub-DAO.\n\n \n\nOur first solution is a framework for a peer reviewed journal publication and open science social graph with native DAO governance on-chain integrated. We are building research primitives and governance technologies to help onboard the next 1000 web3 enabled research sub-DAOs.  \n\nHow we educate and advocate\n\n \n\nProducts take time but our mission can\u2019t wait. That\u2019s why we began creating original applied research from day one. Several emergent research projects have formed that are entirely driven by community participation and championed by a talentDAO researcher. We do our best to provide resources to these groups and onboard more students to help create new ones.\n\n1. DAO Leadership: Sharing leadership is a key tenet of DAOs. Yet distributing leadership across members of a community is easier said than done: there are several instances of centralized leadership within the web3 ecosystem. For this reason we set out to study leadership in the decentralized world of work.\n\nOur researchers are the heart of talentDAO, and in 2022 we saw the Research Guild come to life.\n\nWe are proud to share with you a list of 8 projects that we\u2019ve been working on with our different community-operated teams. This is a summary of our milestones and things we will be working on during 2023, which promises to be an exciting year for the Research Guild. \n\n\n1) Network health survey\nIn decentralized organizations, we have the opportunity to analyze more data than ever before. Governance processes and other on-chain activity is made publicly available thanks to the blockchain and off-chain communication data is accessible through various API services. For example, both Discord and Discourse offer public APIs for data extraction.\n\nBut communication and on-chain activity still do not tell the complete picture of what is happening under the hood. We must also extract data on the psychosocial properties of the organization in order to have a complete understanding of the health of a DAO. To do so, our team has designed a survey that will collect the data necessary to understand the health of organizations so DAO leaders can take action to improve the experience of contributors. Learn more about our process of designing this survey and the theoretical discussion here.\n\nWe will be launching a series of organizational assessment pilot studies in 2023 with DAOs who want to use science-backed tooling to assess their community health. Survey participants will have access to a non-transferable proof of completion NFT made claimable at the end of the survey which will unlock access to future perks and drops. Survey participants will also have the option to opt into our data-sharing program and earn a share of transaction fees generated from our Data NFTs minted on Ocean Marketplace.\n\n2) Project L.I.O.N.\nL.I.O.N: Language Informatics on Organizational Networks\n\nProject LION is a joint DAO effort from talentDAO and LabDAO to build natural language processing systems for analyzing and maintaining community health.\n\nFor DAOs specifically, transaction data can provide insight into on-chain governance operations and degrees of decentralization. However, many DAO operations occur off-chain in the form of relational data. And there is a particular piece of information that is both deeply insightful and stored off-chain: communication.\n\nThis is a software project that will build a tool that will allow us to do research. It is in the development stage and the team is raising funds on Gitcoin. Be sure to check out their grant page if you are as excited about this project as we are. The project roadmap write-up can be found here.\n\n3) Decentralized Leadership\n\u201cDAOs don\u2019t have hierarchies\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have a boss\u201d \u201cDaos are leaderless\u201d\n\n-Is that so?\n\nAt talentDAO, we believe that leadership emerges naturally in any human organization. DAOs are no exception to this, so we decided to study how leadership works in a decentralized space. We began with an extensive literature review on organizational leadership where we covered the last 25+ years of academic research.\n\nThen we moved on to interview leaders from all over the world who work in different DAOs. We talked with more than 20 founders, core members, contributors with long experience in the space, and mentors. All that information is currently being qualitatively analyzed by our team, and we will present the results at ETHDenver and in a future publication.\n\nExpect early research results to be communicated in January 2023. A series of educational workshops, leadership coaching tools, and training seminars will be designed based on the findings of our research on Decentralized Leadership.\n\n4) Onboarding\nOne of the main pain points that DAOs suffer is trying to get a smooth onboarding experience that allows them to get and retain new members. Our team is working on a multi-phase study that aims to know more about the different strategies that the DAO ecosystem has to onboard new people, so we can identify best practices and strategies that suit the different kinds of DAOs. During 2022 the team focused on a literature review to examine existing frameworks to evaluate onboarding experiences (or induction processes, as traditional organizations call them). After that, those frameworks were adapted to the requirements of DAOs and now are ready to be tested in 2023.\n\nIn the coming months, phase 1 will be launched with the recruitment of mystery shoppers that will join different DAOs to experience their onboarding process. We will then evaluate this through ethnographic observations and surveys made with the frameworks we discovered through the literature review. Review more of the project deliverables on the team\u2019s Notion page. \n\n5) DAOversity\nThis study is a collaboration with BanklessDAO where we made a survey asking questions about inclusivity and underrepresented groups, so we could know if members felt comfortable in their space. This is a qualitative confidential study and we managed to collect more than 150 surveys. Right now we are preparing to analyze these responses so we can share the results with the broader community. We are eager to discuss these results to keep debating about people feeling included in DAOs and how we can improve their experiences.\n\n6) Discourse Knowledge Graph\nSo many DAO communities rely on Discourse to host their online forum discussions. These forum discussions are often focused on topics related to changes in the DAO\u2019s protocol or improvements in governance. For a data scientist, the Discourse knowledge base is a treasure trove of data. So why not study it to understand the meta-science of DAO governance? This study seeks to do just that. \n\nWhile the study is in its infancy it has quickly garnered interest within the talentDAO research community. Several data scientists have quickly volunteered to develop a proof of concept of a sensing tool that uses NLP to analyze topics.\n\nCheck out the research proposal cross-posted on the Smart Contract Research Forum to learn more about future directions: research forum post\n\nFor the DAO hackers out there the data notebook has been made public to explore the NLP models being used.\n\n7) Compensation\nAt talentDAO, we conducted a survey investigating the relationship between different compensation structures and contributors\u2019 attitudes like motivation, satisfaction, commitment, and fairness perceptions. Using an experimental vignette study we wanted to understand if certain DAO compensation strategies resulted in more favorable perceptions of organizational justice. The four incentive strategies studied were bounties, Coordinape, hourly payment, and salary. Not surprisingly, salary was viewed as the fairest payment method. Study participants vocalized pay stability as an important factor when determining if they perceived a work environment as fair. Very interestingly, as the DAO community size grew bounty systems were progressively viewed as less favorable. We believe these findings will help inform future DAO compensation design in the tooling space.\n\nThis project was a joint effort with BanklessDAO where we collected 166 respondents. Read more about the full study here: DAO Compensation study\n\nIn 2023 the team aims to do more analysis of this data and then present a written document to share with the community. We also plan to have several open working sessions and webinars related to DAO compensation.\n\n8) DAO Structure & Design study\nThe core objective of the DAO Structure & Design project is to create a well-researched body of knowledge about DAO structures and design. It is not an audit project about what exists, but more about how effective and impactful DAO structures should look like. This body of knowledge will be published so the broader community can discuss the results and make use of these insights.\n\nRight now the team is finishing the literature review so they can move on to do structure analysis and interviews with DAO cartographers (those who map the organizational chart of the DAO) in Q1 2023. After that, the project will move on to Stage 2 to do in-depth interviews with builders, community managers, and experts in the DAO ecosystem to ask about organizational structures in web3 and to see what works and what doesn\u2019t from their perspective.\n",

    "projectDescription": "Note: Donations for this grant are for development only. Do not expect anything in return.\n\n\nHighlights:\nThere is not a single person on any kind of contract in JediSwap. Everything is done by the community and 300+ contributors.\n\nJediSwap is one of the first protocols to receive a grant from Starkware. JediSwap is all time #1 project on Gitcoin Grant from the funders count.\n\nArgent-x(biggest wallet on StarkNet) integrated JediSwap to power swap functionality.\n\n\nWhat is JediSwap?\nJediSwap is a fully composable and permissionless AMM that enables users to swap assets and earn yields on their assets instantly with almost 0 gas fees. Builders can build more advanced applications on top of JediSwap without asking anyone's permission. JediSwap is completely open source for anyone else to use in any way they want.\n\nJediSwap is built on StarkNet - a Validity Rollup on Ethereum enabling unlimited scalability to web3 while relying on the security of Ethereum.\n\n\nJediSwap is an entirely community-driven project. Independent open-source contributors do everything, including development, design, and marketing. Anyone can come and start contributing by joining JediSwap Discord.\n\n\n\nWho is behind it?\nThe Mesh Finance community is leading the development of JediSwap, which has been building in DeFi for the last 24 months. Mesh has been deploying and experimenting with multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and almost all top DeFi protocols.\n\nMesh community is bottom-up; anyone can start contributing and become a leader as they contribute. There is no power concentration. Mesh has developed a system to measure all kinds of contributions, including development, design, community management, growth, etc. Compared to most DAOs, Mesh is not just decentralizing governance but enabling operations and execution in a community-driven way.\n\n\n\nWhat is different?\nThe Mesh community believes that billions of people will come to crypto-only if it is cheap, secure, and easy to use.\n\nCheap - JediSwap will be one of the 1st gasless dapp on StarkNet.\n\nSecure - Thanks to StarkNet, JediSwap leverages the security of Ethereum. Users never rely on multisig bridges to leverage a cheaper and scalable ecosystem.\n\nSimplicity - JediSwap believes in simplicity both for users and builders. Users can swap or earn by adding liquidity in one single click. By keeping the simplicity rule on the smart contracts level, JediSwap also enables devs to build many different kinds of applications, which was impossible on L1s before. There are already 25+ teams building on top of JediSwap. These applications include creating on-chain games, metaverse projects, cross-chain apps, aggregators, and furucombo style dapps.\n\nCommunity - There is not a single employee at JediSwap, and everything is done by the community.\n\n\n\nWhy Validity Rollups (aka ZKRollups) and StarkNet?\nThe next wave of crypto will come for various non-financial applications like gaming. As a result, there will be a 100x number of tokens launching on scalable L2s instead of L1s. These users will prefer the cheapest tx and the most uncomplicated applications that are easy to understand and use. The Mesh community believes StarkNet is a front-runner in the Validity Rollup (also known as ZKRollup) ecosystem. The mesh community has been building on StarkNet since October 2021 and has seen a 20x increase in the number of builders building on StarkNet.\n\n\n\nWhat else is special?\nWhile building JediSwap, the Mesh community is publishing many public goods. Some of the published public goods include\n\nStarkNet React library - it saves hours of work for any builder building a frontend app on StarkNet\n\nBase64 encoding in Cairo - a primitive which can make generative art possible on Starknet\n\nDeFi Pooling(coming soon) - Enabling access to L1 apps by batching txs on StarkNet\n\nDAO tools and frameworks: \n- Ability to give Discord/Twitter contributors tokens/NFTs while preserving the privacy\n- An alert bot for Discord communities and contributors to make coordination easy\n\n\n\nRoadmap:\nCurrent:\nMainnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet mainnet on 30th Nov 2022, and 10000+ users have used JediSwap since then.\n\nTestnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet testnet on Jan 2022 and 150,000+ user have used the JediSwap on testnet since then.\n\nNext 3 months:\nIntegrations - focus on building integrations with 50+ dapps\nLaunch DeFi Pooling as a public good\nOnchain contributor profile\nProductionize DAO tools to make them usable by any community\n\n",

    "projectDescription": "Wordblock is a block based note-taking tool with ownership control.\n\n-Wordblock extension\n\nYou can clip any text from any website, add tags, comments, and save the location (URL) as metadata.\n\nYou can write block-based memos, add tags and extra information(e.g. the real location: \ud83d\udccd\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f38W,4S). For example, when you pick up a book in an antique bookstore, and you want to \"steal\" some words from it before you take it home.\n\nThe text is generated under the user's own DID signature, while data is stored on a distributed content storage network--IPFS to enable public search.\n\n- Wordblock.xyz - a global text block search engine\n\nAll the word blocks created will be pooled in one place for public search, or later public reference.\n\nFor example, you can process public block searches via tags, keywords, or user DID\n\nCompared with local storage note-taking tools like obsidian or central storage Roamresearch, the difference is in data storage in order to achieve public block search.\n\n- Use cases\n\n1) A social graph\nAfter collecting those text blocks, it is easy to form P2P social relations*(e.g. walletChat)* via tag matching.\n\n2) A decentralized multi-lingual literature library\nThe inspiration is when I visited an ancient Malatestiana library (the 1st public library in human history) in Cesena, Italy.\n\nEach codex is tied to the desk with a root ironed chain, so that precise objects could not be stolen, it is now a symbol of the arts of literature, copies include 20 years italian, french and german s copy by using humane scripture called \"literature antiqua\", text includes classical latin authors, churchenergy , greek\u2026\n\nIt's like a warm salute from afar history that tells how humans keep words and knowledge. In the context of today, we stand a chance to \"chain text\" differently and interestingly with technology.\n\nToday, we care less about \"preventing books from being stolen\" but about \"HOW things are connected\", so the desire to build a distributed literature dictionary(library) where people from anywhere in the world could contribute their input even in different languages.\n\nFor example, after I read the Chinese version of\u300aMr.Gywn\u300b, I para-read the original Italian version, then build the connections in between. It is one of the very fun techniques for acquiring a second language through intertextuality, while also a way to let the machine know how people from different linguistic computing systems tell the SAME story.\n\nRead more: https://mirror.xyz/0x65a0Af703047dfDd270361659d02f4f0E8547202/YmbixVzwGJ0l46X6PDtVBbYY64Jd-SfRSD8usBZUzno\n\n3) A data graph\nwe are in the early stage of defining data as an asset with maturing infrastructure like IPFS, Ceramic network, dataverseOS etc, the excitement of web3 is the data as streams that can be visualized and later used by individuals. We could first collect those fragmented attentions \ud83d\udc40 with ease, and then browse/ the data, or re-organize(reference) with personal signature.\n\n- Tech\n\n1) Ceramic Streams\nWordblock uses Ceramic Stream to store the JSON metadata of a block. Metadata includes BlockID, Creation Date, Source URL, Author, Tags, Type, and Content. The DID of the user submitting the block to the Ceramic network is also bound to the metadata. The Wordblock data model can be shared between anplications on the Ceramic network.\n\n2) web3.storage\nWordblock uses web3.storage for data backup and permanent storage.

    "projectDescription": "The Malicious Contract Detector project aims to use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the code of new contracts and identify potential issues or vulnerabilities. The project is divided into two main parts: research and development.\n\nIn the research phase, a variety of algorithms and feature sets will be analyzed, including function signature hashes, abstract syntax trees, opcodes, and even approximate source code, to determine the optimal approach for identifying malicious contracts. The goal is to create a finished machine learning model that can accurately classify contracts as safe or potentially harmful.\n\nIn the development phase, the bot will be created and the process of transforming contract code into a feature set for analysis will be optimized. The focus will be on ensuring that the bot can handle high volumes of incoming contracts in real-time, while maintaining a high level of accuracy and precision.\n\nThe project is currently in the alpha testing stage, with initial results indicating that the BERT transformer model has shown promising results in classifying malicious contracts. A set of bots using different models will be created in order to further improve the accuracy and reliability of the Forta bot.",

    "projectDescription": "ENS Spoofing Bot detects attacks in which someone registers a name visually similar to an existing one. Every ENS user can receive a notification if it happened to their name. \n\n\nThe problem\n\nNames in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it. \n\nThis type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:\n- Substitution of character pairs i/I, i/j, O/0, w/vv, m/rn, etc., which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;\n- Replacing ASCII characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, \u201cfa\u0441eboo\u0441k.eth\u201d uses the letters o and \u0441 from Cyrillic;\n- Use of invisible Unicode symbols; \n- Spoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth. \n\nENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.\n\n\nThe solution\n\nDevelop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering \".eth\" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.\n\nForta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.\n\nIn addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash. \n\nAs a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 19 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.",

Resources are scattered across blog posts and GitHub libraries. This results in a high barrier to entry, thereby slowing the widespread adoption of zk-SNARKs and associated privacy-enhancing technologies. Even worse, implementing zk-SNARKs without understanding the fundamentals of how they work increases the potential for security issues.\n\nWe want to change that with our MoonMath Manual to zk-SNARKs, designed for an audience with only minimal experience in cryptography and programming.\n\nWhat is particularly unique about the MoonMath Manual is that it is designed to enable users to construct zk-SNARKs using simple pen-and-paper computations. Throughout the manual, users are encouraged to complete exercises that ensure they engage with the foundational building blocks of zk-SNARKs. While doing that, readers build the smallest possible \u2014 but fully functional \u2014 cryptographic stack to compute zk-SNARK internals without the need of a computer.\n\nAs users go through the manual, they will grasp mathematical concepts that are not only used in SNARKs, but also in other zero-knowledge proofs and cryptography more generally.",

    "projectDescription": "We propose a framework for on-chain voting that can be grown by a community into a vast landscape of voting contracts. This would be beneficial to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. If there was a system of voting contracts covering a wide range of possible voting types from token-weighted voting via quadratic voting to delegation, then DAOs could simply plug in rather than hard-coding yet another, say, token-weighted voting into their contracts. Plugging in would be as simple as pointing to a deployed voting contract. One can also plug out or exchange the reference from one voting contract to another.\n\nWe have deployed a registry contract to polygon and mainnet (https://etherscan.io/address/0xC535389b5a26efEbc27811915B6d78f6C95433f7) and opened a topic on the Ethereum magicians forum to discuss the EIP draft: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-draft-configurable-voting-contract/10736 \n\nI am currently developing a dapp that lets people interact with a playground, where one can plug in and out of voting contracts and get a feeling for the framework. This site is hosted on ipfs and served through ens: https://votingcontracts.eth.limo/. The development of this app and the deployment of the underlying playground and pluggable voting contracts to ethereum mainnet are the next steps. Feedback is very welcome. Please do reach out with feature requests and ideas. There is also a node package: @leomarlo/voting-registry-contracts, though I am considering migrating that at some point. There are two repositories for this project: https://github.com/leomarlo/voting-contracts-frontend and https://github.com/leomarlo/voting-registry-contracts . \n\n**Updates will appear here!**",

    "projectDescription": "Umbra is a protocol that lets you get paid privately on Ethereum and Layer 2 networks. \n\n----About Umbra----\n\nAs a protocol, Umbra defines a simple set of standards, coupled with a singleton smart contract instance, to enable stealth addresses on Ethereum. With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is. \n\nOn chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they\u2019ve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.\n\nBy leveraging meta-transactions Umbra enables withdrawers to pay relayers for gas using the tokens they\u2019ve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing.\n\n----Project Status----\n\nThe Umbra MVP went live in June 2021. You can visit https://app.umbra.cash to send and receive stealth payments using Umbra.\n\nSince our launch, we've made many iterative improvements based on user feedback. These included better mobile responsiveness, a simpler key registry system, faster scanning when searching for received funds, and other UX enhancements. We've also launched Umbra on Polygon, Optimism, and Umbra, and made huge improvements to our relay system to make token withdrawals faster and cheaper.\n\nSince launch, Umbra has processed nearly 100,000 payments across all networks,  transacting more than $50 Million in value in the process. More than 52,000 accounts have registered stealth keys to enable privacy preserving payments through Umbra. Despite this growth, Umbra remains a grant funded public good project made possible by the community.\n\n---- What's Next----\n\nWe are grateful to our many supporters who have enabled us to get this far. There's still lot's more work to do!\n\nWe believe there is so much more we can do to make Umbra an even more powerful privacy tool in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the year ahead, we're focused on continuing to improve Umbra through withdrawal integrations, new network deployments, performance improvements, and host of small UX improvements and features. We're also working with researchers to develop a Stealth Address EIP, so that Umbra can remain an open, public goods protocol.",

What sets it apart from others (like ENS or UD) is that it can issue multiple domain extensions and allows for various types of names (single-purchase domains, renewable domains, soulbound domains etc.). It has a modular architecture that can cover any use case.\n\nAny DAO or web3 community can get their own domain extension via the Punk Domains protocol. KlimaDAO (.klima), PoolTogether (.pool), Smol Brains NFT community (.smol) and many others have already gotten their own respective domain extensions via Punk Domains.\n\nThe Punk Domains protocol is completely open source (all code is on GitHub) and permissionless - once you own your domain name no one can take it away from you.\n\nWeb3 domains are the essential part of the upcoming Web3 Social where they will be used as usernames and digital identity. Our mission is to help build this future.\n",

    "projectDescription": "SUPPORT THE OPEN METAVERSE\n-\nGeo Web is a set of open protocols & fair property rights for anchoring digital media to physical locations.\n\nIt creates decentralized consensus for an augmented, shared reality layer covering Earth guided by public good values rather than corporate profits. \n\nThe Geo Web will bring digital media, gaming, data, commerce, and NFTs into the physical world as shared experiences rather than siloed applications. \n-\nWhy the Geo Web?\n -\nLarge portions of our lives are shaped by our smart devices. This will only compound with the adoption of augmented reality smart glasses and other always-on wearables/embeddables. The foundations of our lived reality shouldn\u2019t be defined by arbitrary app store rules and the subversive, never-ending drive for corporate profit growth.\n\nWe\u2019re building the Geo Web because we think the metaverse should be based on permissionless, public internet infrastructure. It should be an extension of the ethos/design of the internet, the early web, and Ethereum.\n\nThe Geo Web is divided into digital land parcel NFTs which map 1:1 to the physical world. The market for digital land is administered under a partial common ownership (aka Harberger tax) system. Digital content can be anchored to the land utilizing our p2p content layer (Ceramic, IPFS, & Filecoin).\n\nThe Geo Web is a fair, efficient, and legitimate way to bootstrap and scale the metaverse across our shared planet. \n\nBy reinvesting 100% of land market proceeds into rewarding open-source developers, creatives, advocates, users, and public goods, we can create compounding network utility and value. The Geo Web is a choice for positive-sum coordination over fixed-mindset tradition.\n\nIf the Geo Web is successful, we can help spur the adoption of partial common ownership systems beyond our network and help redefine global property rights systems to be fairer and more efficient.\n-\nUpdate Since GR15\n- \nThe Geo Web launched on Optimism with a fair launch auction on December 15th, 2022! You can claim a parcel at your home, business, or favorite public place now at https://geoweb.land/.  \n\nThis project has been a labor of love for over two years. We couldn't be more excited to be live and thankful for the support of all the Gitcoin contributors that empowered us to make it here.\n-\nPlans for Alpha Round Funding\n-\nWith the Geo Web platform/economic system live, the core team is shifting focus to building and supporting use cases with partners, builders, and creators. \n\nFunds received from this QF round will primarily be distributed to core team members and open source contributors through Coordinape Circles and/or Govrn's DAO contributor platform as we maintain that use case focus.  We may allocate some of the funds to bounties on Dework and incidental costs of development/tooling/hosting use cases as well.\n\nThese funds will help bridge the core team until the Geo Web digital land market produces enough revenue to fund its own QF rounds (https://docs.geoweb.network/community-and-governance/network-funds-allocation). \n-\nLinks\n-\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/sbqWRGhb\nCadastre - https://geoweb.land/\nSpatial Browser - https://geoweb.app/\nWebsite - https://geoweb.network/\nGithub - https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project\nDework Bounties - https://app.dework.xyz/geo-web\nForum - https://forum.geoweb.network/\nDocs - https://docs.geoweb.network/\nTwitter - @thegeoweb\nNewsletter Signup - https://bit.ly/geowebsignup\nBlog - https://geoweb.network/blog\n",

    "projectDescription": "Blaine Bublitz builds infrastructure for ETH/ZK application development. He also collaborates closely with the Dark Forest team and other 0xPARC-adjacent projects.\n\nBlaine is a developer who is excited about web tech, open source, the future of decentralized virtual worlds, and ZK applications. He got hooked during the first public round of Dark Forest and has been building in the ZK application ecosystem ever since.  Some of his work includes:\n\n** ZK Tooling and hardhat-circom **\n\nIn collaboration with Jacob Rosenthal, Blaine helped to rewrite Dark Forest's zkSNARK build processes. This work was generalized into the hardhat-circom plugin, a configurable hardhat plugin which provides developers with a set of ZK circuit build tasks, and provides TypeScript declarations for snarkjs.\n\n** Contributions to circom & snarkjs **\n\nBlaine contributes to circom and snarkjs on a regular basis. He\u2019s provided patches to reduce the bundle build by 50% and enabled WebWorker support.\n\n** Hardhat plugins **\n\nBlaine created and maintains a series of hardhat plugins, such as hardhat-diamond-abi and hardhat-settings, which make large-scale projects easier to manage. All of these plugins were made possible through funding raised on Gitcoin and will continue to be maintained as long as they are useful to people!\n\n** Project Sophon **\n\nAs one half of Project Sophon, Blaine open sources many experiments related to Dark Forest or other ZK ecosystem projects, such as darkforest-local, Broadcast market, and DF plugin-dev-server.\n\nGitcoin contributions will support Blaine's ongoing open-source work on ZK infrastructure, crypto-native gaming, and developer tools.",

    "projectDescription": "Idena is the first blockchain that utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-Of-Person, which prioritizes people over tokens. Unlike other systems that rely on money-based governance, Idena operates on the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" ensuring that power is distributed equally among all participants. This prevents a small group from gaining too much control. \n\nIdena offers a puppet-resistant crypto-identity primitive, which is used for democratic voting, Quadratic Funding, fair airdrops and decentralized governance.\n\nIdena is accessible to anyone. It does not require any personal information and allows participants to join the network without any investments. Users play an active role in mutual verification by challenging each other with AI-resistant FLIP-tests. This process is done in a synchronous ceremony, which ensures that individuals cannot spoof multiple accounts.\n\nThe network is protected from Sybil attacks through regular validations and Quadratic Staking. Quadratic Staking is a mechanism that prevents large stake holders from dominating the network and encourages small individuals to secure their identities with stakes ensuring democratic staking rewards distribution.\n ",

    "projectDescription": "Spect helps crypto native organizations centralize context and decentralize decision making at the same time.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nAs DAOs scale to larger number of contributors, it is naturally becoming harder and harder to maintain a shared sense of context among all contributors. This has led to the formation of sub-DAOs and guilds. However, most of the current tooling to manage grants, bounties and tasks, distribute rewards and make decisions are built for monolithic DAOs instead of modular ones. Moreover, these tools are point solution which means each tool serves a specific purpose. Therefore, with every addition of a new tool for a new use case, there is a loss of context among contributors.\n\n**About Spect**\n\nAt Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to form circles (or sub-DAOs) that manage grants, bounties and tasks. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build history of contributions with soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials.\n\n**What can Spect be used for today?**\n\n1. Forming organizations that can scale N levels deep\n2. Run Ecosystem Grants Program\n3. Run Onboarding Program\n4. Run Surveys\n5. Manage Tasks and Contacts as a community\n\nHere are docs on how these can be implemented in an organization -\nhttps://docs.spect.network/\n\n**Features**\n\n1. Fully customizable tables, kanbans, lists and gantts which can be used to setup workflows\n3. Web3 enabled, sybil protected forms with ability to analyze and export responses\n3. Extensive Automations to automate chores\n4. Credentialing using soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials\n5. Payment on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and Avalanche with any token using personal wallets or gnosis multi-sigs.\n\n**Integrations**\n\n1. Discord to map roles and automatically assign roles, send messages and create channels using automations.\n2. Guild.xyz to map roles and give granular permissions\n3. Gitcoin Passport for creating sybil protected forms\n4. Mintkudos to distribute soulbound tokens to contributors\n5. Snapshot to run voting periods on form responses and other data\n\n**What is upcoming?**\n\n1. Templated Use cases - Organizations will be able to setup advanced workflows within seconds with templates\n2. Complete Composability - Spect will be made composable on various different levels. Both developers and non-developers will be able to build their own applications with Spect. We already have an early version of our API docs that developers can use. In the near future, tables, lists, boards and forms will be made embeddable such that non-developers can build their own experiences using these.\n3. Make it possible for anyone to build custom widgets and bots on Spect.\n\n**How we will use the funding?**\n\nThe funding will be used to pay for infrastructure costs and contributor salaries.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. Fill up the early adopter form and claim a soulbound token -\nhttps://circles.spect.network/r/074c06d9-120f-4b99-87a9-c0f6e415c9a3\n\n2. Create your first circle on\nhttps://circles.spect.network/\n\n3. Follow us on Twitter -\nhttps://twitter.com/JoinSpect\n\n4. Come say gm on\nhttps://discord.gg/AxWkJVfN\n\n5. Read and collect our manifesto -\nhttps://mirror.xyz/chaks.eth/us5rOm1jSsvmvqBOmef_SZSP6zzbNeo7ay-_DkacC64\n",

    "projectDescription": "THE BANKLESSDAO MISSION...\nBanklessDAO is a decentralised community coordinating and propagating bankless media, culture, and education. BanklessDAO launched on May 4, 2021, and its goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truly bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.\nTogether, the BanklessDAO community collaborates to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralised financial technologies through education, media and culture.\nThe BanklessDAO community runs a variety of projects; for the scope of this grant we are focusing on the ones which truly provide goods and services for the entire world such as BANKLESS ACADEMY, BANKLESS AFRICA, and INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES. \nThe projects listed below have had contributors working on them for many months and although some of the project contributors earn governance tokens, the work being done far outstrips the existing remuneration. Second, and perhaps more important, is that all these projects aim to help the wider crypto ecosystem and not just the Bankless community \u2014 and hence are public goods.\nBANKLESS ACADEMY\n\ud83d\ude80 Brief\nBankless Academy is a leading web3 \"knowledge on-ramp\" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.\nWe're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to go Bankless.\n\ud83d\udd25 Vision\nWe are building a web3 world where:\n\ud83d\udcda Information is frictionless and free.\n\ud83d\udc4a Communities are high impact creators.\n\ud83c\udf10 Education is permissionless (no central body dictates what you can/can't see).\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Trajectory\nCurrent focuses:\nEstablish a Bankless-native syllabus/user journey to move users from Centralised Exchanges to Ethereum Layer2 self-custody.\nPursue collaboration with popular dApps to educate users on trusted tools available to them.\nBuild theory lessons with expert guests from the Bankless 'Hall of Fame'.\nForm frontier partnerships so that the Academy dApp continues to support interoperability and cutting-edge use cases.\nContinue research, development, and onboarding for our whitelabel platform to scale our efforts into other web3 ecosystems.\nBuild a framework for contributor content creation to empower talented community educators.\n\ud83d\udcc0 Try the dApp:\nhttps://app.banklessacademy.com/\nMultiple wallets supported\nMobile friendly\nNo download\nhttps://giveth.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPkVpSqhUr1bUALLHL2ErzytqM5wHh2RmkCF82GApe8Lv\n\ud83c\udf0f Let's scale permissionless education together!\nBANKLESS AFRICA\nOur community is focused on promoting the bDAO mission. We leverage crypto-based creations like Bitcoin, Defi, NFTs etc. to tackle problems faced by Africans.\nAchievement/Growth:\n*Our podcast highlights projects and people making impact in the African crypto/Web3 ecosystem.\n*Our Newsletter provides well curated information on Bitcoin, DeFi, crypto regulations, projects and Web3 funding in the crypto/Web3 space in Africa.\n*Our website helps Africans access educational courses. It includes a link to Bankless Academy where lots of Web3 courses are available. Eventually this website will become a native-educational platform for Africans.\nWebsite v1 here: https://banklessafrica.com/\n*We onboard and train contributors with various Web3 ethos, teaching them how to contribute in various DAOs and potentially bootstrap project ideas they have.\nSome links to get into our community: https://linktr.ee/banklessafrica.\n\ud83c\udf0f INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES (IMN)\nOnly 5% of the world\u2019s population are native English speakers and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80% by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, the Metaverse and Web3. All links: https://www.banklessimn.xyz/\nThe International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them/opening the door for them to onboard to Web3 is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want Web3 to be any different from Web2.\nThe story so far\u2026\nIn Q1 2022, the total audience grew by 52% as compared to the previous quarter and our total reach is over 40,000 audience members in over 20 languages. We have more than 100 active contributors speaking 20 different languages from all parts of the world. We have worked with prominent DAOs in Web3 such as Polygon, Tribe and Yearn.\nOver the next months and years, as we continue to produce content we will also start developing local language communities which will develop Web3 talent in local languages as well as organising events in different geographical locations to onboard more people.\n\nOur Ask to the Crypto Community ...\nAt the highest level, the Web3 education provided by BanklessDAO stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.\nWe seriously can\u2019t wait to show you what we have to offer this space.\nLet\u2019s Impact Together!\nBanklessDAO believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world, both in learning and translation. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone.\nLet\u2019s help the world go Bankless!",

    "projectDescription": "Datalatte is a two-sided dApp that enables people to anonymize, tokenize, and monetize their data, while providing researchers and organizations with survey-based insights to develop and improve their products.\n\nDatalatte aims at transforming market research towards ethical practices with a focus on the ownership and privacy of data. This leads to bridging the economic gap by enabling people to monetize their digital footprint on a secure and fair decentralized application. Currently, traditional apps often harvest user data and sell it to other companies without the user's knowledge or consent, and users receive no compensation for their data. This has led to the rise of large corporations that hold a monopoly on data and influence our daily lives. At the same time, researchers and small and medium-sized companies struggle to obtain data to build predictive models for various purposes, such as finding jobs, providing healthcare, and educating children.\n\nSince the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, internet users have the right to access their personal data on each platform. However, many people are unaware of this right and the value of their data. Datalatte aims to address this issue by leveraging decentralized technologies such as cryptocurrency, decentralized applications, and exchanges to empower people to gain control over their data and its use.\n\nTo achieve data democracy, Datalatte plans to store tokenized data in users' wallets using protocols like IPFS and Filecoin for decentralized storage and Ocean protocol's Data NFTs for compliant and self-sovereign data licensing and monetization. However, the current table-structured data model is not easily understandable and requires significant resources to extract insights. Datalatte aims to address this issue by using a graph-structured data model based on small Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which allow for easy access and utilization of data through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and offer higher computational efficiency through privacy-preserving data pipelines.\n\nThe goals of Datalatte include empowering internet users to monetize their data, providing data scientists with access to affordable data, enabling full control and ownership of personal data for internet users, and creating a data-backed income through personal data monetization. To achieve these objectives, Datalatte will develop a decentralized data store that allows users to sell their data rather than having it sold by large corporations.\n\nOverall, Datalatte aims to create a more equitable and transparent system for data monetization by empowering individuals and providing researchers and small businesses with access to valuable data.",

    "projectDescription": "For over 30 years, EFF has been the leading nonprofit advocate for the privacy and free speech rights of technology creators and ordinary users. Our team achieves success through impact litigation, policy analysis and education, grassroots activism, technology development, and support from the public. EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.\n\nCOMMUNITY ADVOCACY\n\nFrom the early days of the web, EFF understood that we must protect access to technology in order to advance freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used its fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies. EFF\u2019s work in the growing movement for web decentralization and the public interest internet is no different.\n\nIn order to combat the ever-consolidating power of corporate giants (and end the gatekeeping, surveillance, and censorship that often accompany them), many have looked toward blockchain-based technology and cryptocurrency for remedies. EFF is optimistic about the ability of digital currency to support independent community projects, route around financial censorship, and support independent journalists around the world.\n\nWhile there are still many problems to solve in the blockchain ecosystem, the world needs thoughtful, user-focused advocates like EFF to help uncover the opportunities for public good. This is why EFF fought a poorly-defined cryptocurrency provision in the Biden Administration\u2019s infrastructure bill that could create onerous requirements affecting user privacy, and EFF also introduced bright-line rules that Congress should adopt when developing cryptocurrency regulations; we\u2019ve written extensively about the ways financial intermediaries censor legal speech; we submitted comments to FinCEN opposing the agency\u2019s proposal for new privacy-invasive regulations of cryptocurrency transactions; and we\u2019ve called for blockchain intermediaries to issue transparency reports and protect the rights of their users. During the Tornado Cash controversy, EFF spoke out for the speech protections on software code and represented Johns Hopkins Professor Matthew Green, who made a fork of the code and posted the replica so it would be available for study. EFF also reached out to The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to seek more clarity on their interpretation of the sanctions listing. \n\nOPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS\n\nWhile EFF is proud to be a leading voice in online rights debates, we also develop gratis and open source tools to enhance everyone\u2019s freedom online. Your donations provide critical  support for EFF\u2019s wide-ranging work, which includes projects such as:\n\n- Atlas of Surveillance: This project launched in collaboration with hundreds of EFF members and university students. With over 10,000 data points and counting, the Atlas is the largest searchable database of U.S. law enforcement\u2019s surveillance technologies.\n\n- Certbot: This software tool allows you to automatically deploy Let's Encrypt certificates to enable HTTPS on your website. EFF even helped develop Let\u2019s Encrypt which has in turn enabled free and easy encryption across the web!\n\n- Cover Your Tracks: This successor to EFF\u2019s Panopticlick demonstrates how well your browser and add-ons protect you from tracking and fingerprinting.\n\n- HTTPS Everywhere: This tool automatically connects users to the encrypted version of many major sites. Just over a decade after its launch, EFF declared success and announced the planned deprecation of our HTTPS Everywhere plugin because the functionality had been incorporated into all of the major web browsers, making it unnecessary.\n\n- Privacy Badger: With millions of active installs, this browser add-on was the first to specifically focus on blocking tracking in advertisements, instead of just the ads themselves. EFF\u2019s open-source technology has also inspired other widely used privacy tools, including the Brave browser and Safari\u2019s tracker blocking.\n\nThe world relies on the internet to stay connected and informed more than ever before, and that gives you a pivotal opportunity to stand up for technology users everywhere. Your support for EFF ensures that we always have a vocal advocate wherever tech and civil liberties meet.",

    "projectDescription": "We build tools and protocols that enable impact-driven communities to deploy their own token economy to advance their mission through regenerative funding, commons governance and community building. The Token Engineering Commons was the first successful launch using our Commons design patterns. We plan to support on-the-ground ReFi communities next and open source our protocols to allow other purpose or public good-focused communities to deploy their own Commons. \n\nPlease also consider supporting our joint venture with ReFi DAO to build a ReFi Commons Incubator: https://grantshub.gitcoin.co/#/chains/1/registry/0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4/projects/179\n\nDonate to Refi Commons as well here!\n\n\nWHAT IS COMMONS STACK?\n\nCommons Stack started as a think-tank primarily focused on crypto-economic primitives to underpin a design framework for a Commons, a tokenized community with a mission benefitting a public good. We aspired to scale commons as a way to realign incentives with public goods. To achieve this, we needed to elaborate cultural designs that reinforce commoning principles and create novel tools such as the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), Conviction Voting (CV) and the Praise reward and reputation system. \n\nOur Commons design patterns are made up of a suite of cultural frameworks and a curated library of tools for governance, funding, proposal, analytics and initialization of a Commons. Some have come straight out of our research collaborations -  such as the ABC, CV and Praise. We also use Collaborative Economics, a methodology for enabling the community to collectively propose iterate and finalize the parameters of their Commons\u2019 economy.\n\nWe see the work of Elinor Ostrom as our North Star and set out to weave her principles of governing commons into the cultural fabric of a Commons. Our Cultural Build defines practices for clear boundaries, conflict resolution, monitoring, participatory decision-making, and others principles. \n\nOther things we have done are supporting BlockScience in open-sourcing cadCAD, developing the edutainment program Commons Simulator, launching the Trusted Seed, developing a collaborative economics method, deploying the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) - the first field test for our Commons design patterns, launching the Commons Prize and doing a discovery of the needs of Grassroots Economics, the winner of the prize.\n\nWhile we have already had some success, we have only just begun. Our research continues. The lessons learned from a first field test, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our curated commons library of tools and processes continues to evolve. \n\nWe did not get this far alone. We have collaborated with BlockScience, Blossom Labs, Metagov, Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Giveth, 1Hive, Aragon, Token Engineering Academy, Token Engineering Commons, and many others.\n\nMuch of our Github activity (https://github.com/commons-stack) is collaborative. We work hand in hand with General Magic, Token Engineering Commons and Praise, specifically:\nhttps://github.com/givepraise/\nhttps://github.com/commonsbuild\nhttps://github.com/GeneralMagicio/\n\n\nPLANS FOR ALPHA ROUND FUNDING\n\nFor this round, we will focus on one deliverable - donations to this grant will contribute to the costs of open-sourcing our Commons deployment protocols. Our intention in doing so is to allow any community to deploy its own commons-inspired economy, i.e, the intentionally ground-up launch of an economy to support a purpose or public good.\n\nWe are in process of building the guidelines for initializing and deploying a Commons. Funding will enable our team to continue our work on the open-source documentation of our deployment protocols that will help Commons facilitate the communal management of public goods through a regenerative economic system. \n\nThe documentation covers the four phases of the Commons deployment: Engage, Incubate, Hatch and Launch. In every phase, we outline the processes, tools and different concepts that will bring about the creation of a sustainable and scalable Commons.\n\n \nUPDATES SINCE GR15\n \nDonations from the Gitcoin GR15 helped our team accomplish the following in the last quarter:\n \n- We worked with our pilot Commons to grant over $400,000 to various Token Engineering initiatives, via the economic system we collectively designed.\n\n- The Token Engineering Commons has proved out the value of the Augmented Bonding Curve and Trusted Seed approach, as participating in the Hatch has been one of the better investments in crypto (beating the price of ETH by over 2x)\n\n- Co-developed Praise and spun it out to be its own independent project, focused on becoming a reputation system and rewards distribution tool. We open-sourced the deployment and supported several communities in using it.\n\n - Worked on-the-ground in Kenya with Grassroots Economics to understand the needs for their complex economic model and jointly explore possible solutions.\n\n- Initiated the \u201cLaunch a Commons\u201d campaign to engage purpose-driven web3 communities in becoming tokenized communities that will create and steward public goods.\n\nThank you for your generosity! \ud83d\ude4f",

    "projectDescription": "What are Optinames?\n\nOptinames are tradable and transferable sub-domains wrapped as ERC721s & fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on L1 Ethereum by utilizing an off-chain resolver.\n\nImportant Links:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/stevegachau/optimismresolver\n\nOff-chain Resolver on L1 - https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain NFTs on Optimism - https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain Example on ENS App - https://app.ens.domains/name/nick.ecc.eth/details\n\nSubdomain Example on Etherscan - https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Rainbow Wallet - https://rainbow.me/nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Opensea - https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x9fb848300E736075eD568147259bF8a8eeFe4fEf/2\n\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nThis project is leading the charge in making it easier & cheaper to acquire and utilize ens domains. We are implementing the latest technologies released by the ENS team (CCIP Read & Off-chain resolution) to make it possible for users to register subdomains on Optimism while making them available & resolvable on L1 Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to providing free ENS subdomain on Optimism (currently ecc.eth), OptiNames is partnering with NFT projects & gaming communities building their games on any Layer 2. These communities will be utilizing our tech and smart contracts to provide free usernames & gamer-tags that double up as ENS subdomains.\n\nAdoption:\n\nThe first project utilizing Optinames to issue subdomains to their community is ECC Name Service. ECC Name Service has since grown to become the Number 1 domain collection on Optimism.\n\nRegistrations: 17,725\n\nWhat Next?: Optinames is working on and will soon be launching ENS Wildcards on L2\n\nMany NFT communities on Ethereum and L2s have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, requiring each NFT holder to manually register an ENS subdomain can be cumbersome. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names.\n\nWildcard subdomains offer a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder to receive an ENS name automatically at no cost & without any registration step. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (linked to an NFTs token ID) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection.\n",

Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts. The user can then use their BrightID verification to prove to any integrated system that they have one and only one account. The potential integrations are endless.\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Where will my contributions go?\nBrightID Main DAO is a LAO (a DAO with a legal wrapper) that stewards centralized pieces until they can be decentralized, such as the app registry, website, and app store entries. It also has stewardship over grant and sponsorship income, and functions as a non-profit. It has been committed to BrightID\u2019s core mission and funded the core team since its inception in Feb 2020.\n100% of contributed funds will go to BMAIN DAO.\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Bright DAO!\nBright DAO pulls in many contributors from the community to grow BrightID at a faster pace. Using the gardens DAO format pioneered by 1Hive, contributors can create their own proposals and receive their own funding in $BRIGHT community governance tokens.\n\nCome help us build a brighter world.\n\n",

    "projectDescription": "Hey all, we're building free and open source tools to help you stay safe in web3! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nTo use tokens in decentralised applications such as Uniswap you have to grant the application permission to spend tokens on your behalf - known as an allowance. Allowances are an important part of using these apps, but can be dangerous if left unchecked.\n\nBugs can exists and exploits can happen even in established projects, and by approving token allowances you are potentially exposing your wallet to these exploits. To keep yourself safe from allowance exploits it is a good practice to regularly inspect and revoke your allowances.\n\nRevoke.cash comes in as a preventative tool to manage your token allowances and practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active allowances you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of allowance exploits.\n\nIn many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an allowance while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases. When these phishing scams happen, it is recommended to use Revoke.cash to mitigate the damage, but it is even better to prevent the scam in the first place.\n\nThis is where the Revoke.cash Browser Extension comes in. The extension pops up whenever you are about to sign an allowance and will inform you of the allowance details. This can help you prevent signing malicious allowances.",
