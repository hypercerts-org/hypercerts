# Create projects and events data for Open Source Observer

# Setup

1. Set environment variables in a `.env` file. You'll need API access credentials for Alchemy, Etherscan, Github, and Supabase.

2. Install the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Adding projects

Projects must be stored in a JSON with the following fields:

- name
- description
- github_org

A database of projects can then be initialized with the following command in `src/database.py`:

`insert_projects_and_wallets_from_json("data/projects.json")`

# Fetching Github events for a project

Once the database of projects is created, you can trigger the script to gather Github events with the following command in `src/database.py`:

`insert_all_events()`

Don't forget to review constant settings for:

```
START, END = '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z', '2023-04-30T00:00:00Z'
QUERIES = ["merged PR", "issue", "created PR"]
```

Note: there is currently no detection of duplicate entries in the database, so be careful modifying these settings.

# Fetching financial transactions linked to a project's Ethereum address

The script uses Zerion to download all transaction data for a wallet address.

`$ python src/zerion_scraper.py`

It will store all of the CSV files in a local directory:

`STORAGE_DIR = "data/temp"`

Finally, these can be added to the events database through the following command in `src/database.py`:

`insert_zerion_transactions()`
