# Updated environment initialization

- Initialize the client with `{environment: "test"}` or `{environment: "production"}` instead of providing a chainID.
  This will enable queries to the correct graph.
- `WalletClient` is not required. When initializing without a wallet client, or when the wallet client is set to a chain
  not supported in the environment, the SDK will default to read only mode.
- `PublicClient` is not required. This client is mostly used for transaction simulation. When initializing without a
  publicClient, the SDK will default to a public client provided by `viem` for the chain specified by the
  `WalletClient`.

# Updated Graph client and queries

- `SDK` now exports `graphClient` which can be used to query the graph directly.
- Updated queries:

```
  HypercertById,
  HypercertsByOwner,
  FractionsByHypercert,
  FractionsByOwner,
  RecentHypercerts,
  FractionById,
  MetadataByUri,
  MetadataForHypercert
```

- When using VSCode we recommend using [gql.tada](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada) for syntax highlighting and other
  nifty features.

# Removed methods

- `getData`
- `getMetadata` -> in favor of using the Graph

# Nerd stuff

- GraphQL client autogenerated from the graph schema.
- API client autogenerated from the graph schema.
