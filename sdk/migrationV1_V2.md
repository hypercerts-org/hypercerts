# Updated environment initialization

- Initialize the client with `{environment: "test"` or `{environment: "production"}` instead of providing a chainID.
  This will enable queries to the correct graph.
- For reading evm state, we follow the publicClient's connected chain.
- WalletClient is not required. When initializing without a walletClient, or when the walletClient is set to a chain not
  supported in the environment, the SDK will default to read only mode.

# Updated Graph client and queries

- `SDK` now exports `graphClient` which can be used to query the graph directly.
- Updated queries:

```
  HypercertById,
  HypercertsByOwner,
  FractionsByHypercert,
  FractionsByOwner,
  RecentHypercerts,
  FractionById,
  MetadataByUri,
  MetadataForHypercert
```

- When using VSCode we recommend using [gql.tada](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada) for syntax highlighting and other
  nifty features.

# Removed methods

- `getData`
- `getMetadata` -> in favor of using the Graph

# Nerd stuff

- GraphQL client autogenerated from the graph schema.
- API client autogenerated from the graph schema.
