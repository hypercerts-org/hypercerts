> TransferManager

This contract provides the transfer functions for ERC721/ERC1155/Hypercert/Hyperboard for contracts that require them. Collection type &quot;0&quot; refers to ERC721 transfer functions. Collection type &quot;1&quot; refers to ERC1155 transfer functions. Collection type &quot;2&quot; refers to Hypercert transfer functions. Collection type &quot;3&quot; refers to Hyperboard transfer functions.

_&quot;Safe&quot; transfer functions for ERC721 are not implemented since they come with added gas costs to verify if the recipient is a contract as it requires verifying the receiver interface is valid._
