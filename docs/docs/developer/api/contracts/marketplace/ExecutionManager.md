> ExecutionManager

This contract handles the execution and resolution of transactions. A transaction is executed on-chain when an off-chain maker order is matched by on-chain taker order of a different kind. For instance, a taker ask is executed against a maker bid (or a taker bid against a maker ask).

## Methods

### MAGIC_VALUE_ORDER_NONCE_EXECUTED

```solidity
function MAGIC_VALUE_ORDER_NONCE_EXECUTED() external view returns (bytes32)
```

Magic value nonce returned if executed (or cancelled).

#### Returns

| Name | Type    | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| \_0  | bytes32 | undefined   |

### addStrategy

```solidity
function addStrategy(uint16 standardProtocolFeeBp, uint16 minTotalFeeBp, uint16 maxProtocolFeeBp, bytes4 selector, bool isMakerBid, address implementation) external nonpayable
```

This function allows the owner to add a new execution strategy to the protocol.

_Strategies have an id that is incremental. Only callable by owner._

#### Parameters

| isMakerBid            | bool    | Whether the function selector is for maker bid |
| implementation        | address | Implementation address                         |

### cancelOrderNonces

```solidity
function cancelOrderNonces(uint256[] orderNonces) external nonpayable
```

This function allows a user to cancel an array of order nonces.

_It does not check the status of the nonces to save gas and to prevent revertion if one of the orders is filled in the same block._

#### Parameters

| Name        | Type      | Description           |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| orderNonces | uint256[] | Array of order nonces |

### cancelOwnershipTransfer

```solidity
function cancelOwnershipTransfer() external nonpayable
```

This function is used to cancel the ownership transfer.

_This function can be used for both cancelling a transfer to a new owner and cancelling the renouncement of the ownership._

### cancelSubsetNonces

```solidity
function cancelSubsetNonces(uint256[] subsetNonces) external nonpayable
```

This function allows a user to cancel an array of subset nonces.

_It does not check the status of the nonces to save gas._

#### Parameters

| Name         | Type      | Description            |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| subsetNonces | uint256[] | Array of subset nonces |

### confirmOwnershipRenouncement

```solidity
function confirmOwnershipRenouncement() external nonpayable
```

This function is used to confirm the ownership renouncement.

### confirmOwnershipTransfer

```solidity
function confirmOwnershipTransfer() external nonpayable
```

This function is used to confirm the ownership transfer.

_This function can only be called by the current potential owner._

### creatorFeeManager

```solidity
function creatorFeeManager() external view returns (contract ICreatorFeeManager)
```

Creator fee manager.

#### Returns

| Name | Type                        | Description |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| \_0  | contract ICreatorFeeManager | undefined   |

### incrementBidAskNonces

```solidity
function incrementBidAskNonces(bool bid, bool ask) external nonpayable
```

This function increments a user&#39;s bid/ask nonces.

_The logic for computing the quasi-random number is inspired by Seaport v1.2. The pseudo-randomness allows non-deterministic computation of the next ask/bid nonce. A deterministic increment would make the cancel-all process non-effective in certain cases (orders signed with a greater ask/bid nonce). The same quasi-random number is used for incrementing both the bid and ask nonces if both values are incremented in the same transaction. If this function is used twice in the same block, it will return the same quasiRandomNumber but this will not impact the overall business logic._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description                             |
| ---- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| bid  | bool | Whether to increment the user bid nonce |
| ask  | bool | Whether to increment the user ask nonce |
