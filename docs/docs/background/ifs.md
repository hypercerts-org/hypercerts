title: Impact Funding Systems (IFSs)

### An IFS consists of
- **Actors:** Contributors, funders, evaluators, and beneficiaries
- **Funding mechanisms:** Grants, bounties, retrospective funding, etc.
- **Coordination mechanisms:** Roadmapping, communication forums, etc.
- **A goal:** Maximize the domain-specific positive value created (impact)

The goal will be specific to the impact area, e.g. prevent existential risks from artificial intelligence (AI) would be the goal for the impact area “AI safety.” To achieve these goals, skilled contributors must work with high effort on promising projects. Additionally, for those projects that create impact continuously, sufficient income streams are necessary to cover both their ongoing operating expenses and contributors’ upside incentives.

### Guiding questions for designing IFSs
1. **Projects:** How can we improve the chances that the most promising projects are worked on?
2. **Talent & resources:** How can we attract top talent to contribute to the most promising projects and provide them with the necessary resources?
3. **Effort:** How can we reward contributors for their impact on outcomes?
4. **Sustainable income:** How can we create recurring income streams and financial sustainability for impactful projects?

Markets have been proven very powerful in answering these questions if they are directed towards maximizing profits. As we are directing systems towards maximizing impact, these answers become more challenging. In particular, in an IFS we are facing coordination and incentive problems in funding impact, such as the free-rider problem.
