# Deploy a new proxy contract

This should be done only on rare occasions. For example, when:

- We want to deploy to a new network
- We have updated the contract in a way that is _NOT_ backwards-compatible.
  - For most upgrades, please use UUPS [upgrades](./upgrade.md).

## Smart Contracts

### Setup the `contracts/` environment

Navigate to `contracts/`. Configure your `.env` file by following the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts/tree/main/contracts#setup).

### Build and deploy the smart contracts

If you are deploying on a new network, configure `contracts/hardhat.config.ts` to support the new network under the `networks` key.

```javascript
    "optimism-goeri": getChainConfig("optimism-goerli"),
```

Build the contracts and deploy. Specify the network to match the key used in `hardhat.config.ts`.

```sh
# Run in contracts/
yarn build:hardhat
yarn hardhat deploy --network NETWORK
```

This will output the new proxy address. Update the root `README.md` with this new address.

Now transfer ownership over the proxy contract to the multisig:

```sh
yarn hardhat transfer-owner --network NETWORK --proxy PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --owner MULTISIG_ADDRESS
```

## Subgraph

### Setup the `graph/` environment

Navigate to `graph/`. Follow the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts/tree/main/graph#setup)
to get set up.

### Deploy the subgraph

Update `graph/networks.json` with the new proxy address. To speed up indexing, you set the `startBlock` to the block containing the contract creation. We can add multiple networks that are monitored by the same subgraph. For more details, see the [Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-hosted/#deploying-the-subgraph-to-multiple-ethereum-networks).

Now deploy the subgraph

```sh
# Run in graph/
yarn build
yarn deploy:hosted
```

## OpenZeppelin Defender

### Create a new Supabase table

Log into the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/).
We store all data in a single project, but use different tables for each network.
The table name should be suffixed by the network (e.g. `allowlistCache-goerli`).
If you are deploying to a new network, create a new table. You can copy the table schema and RLS policy from another pre-existing table.

If you are deploying a new proxy contract to a network for which you already have another deployment, you'll have to make a judgement call as to whether you can reuse the existing table, whether you need to clear the existing table, or create another table.

Note: We want to merge all the tables in this [issue](https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts/issues/477).

### Update the OpenZeppelin Defender scripts

Modify the Defender scripts to support the new network in `defender/src/networks.ts`.

If the ABI of the contract has changed, make sure you also update `defender/src/HypercertMinterABI.ts`.

Note: The entry point for deployment is in `defender/src/setup.ts`.

### Setup the `defender/` environment

Navigate to `defender/`. Follow the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts/tree/main/defender#setup)
to get set up.

### Deploy defender scripts

Deploy to OpenZeppelin Defender via

```sh
# Run in defender/
yarn deploy
```

## Hypercerts SDK

TODO: Flesh this out

Run the build in `contracts/`.

(Soon to be deprecated) Publish `contracts/` to npm

Configure the SDK to support the new network via the graphclient.

Publish SDK to npm

## Deploy the Dapp frontend

Each frontend build is configured to run on a different network (e.g. `https://testnet.hypercerts.org`). You can use any CDN to serve the site (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Fleek, Firebase Hosting).

1. Configure your build environment with the environment variables specified in `frontend/.env.local.example`.

2. Configure your builds to the following settings:

- Build command: `yarn build:site`
- Build output directory: `/build`
- Root directory: `/`

3. Configure the domain that you want for your build.
