> InheritedStrategy

This contract handles the verification of parameters for standard transactions. It does not verify the taker struct&#39;s itemIds and amounts array as well as minPrice (taker ask) / maxPrice (taker bid) because before the taker executes the transaction and the maker itemIds/amounts/price should have already been confirmed off-chain.

_A standard transaction (bid or ask) is mapped to strategyId = 0._
