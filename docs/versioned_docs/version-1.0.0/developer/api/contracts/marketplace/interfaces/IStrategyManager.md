## Events

### NewStrategy

```solidity
event NewStrategy(uint256 strategyId, uint16 standardProtocolFeeBp, uint16 minTotalFeeBp, uint16 maxProtocolFeeBp, bytes4 selector, bool isMakerBid, address implementation)
```

It is emitted when a new strategy is added.

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| strategyId            | uint256 | Id of the new strategy                               |
| standardProtocolFeeBp | uint16  | Standard protocol fee (in basis point)               |
| minTotalFeeBp         | uint16  | Minimum total fee (in basis point)                   |
| maxProtocolFeeBp      | uint16  | Maximum protocol fee (in basis point)                |
| selector              | bytes4  | Function selector for the transaction to be executed |
| isMakerBid            | bool    | Whether the strategyId is for maker bid              |
| implementation        | address | Address of the implementation of the strategy        |

### StrategyUpdated

```solidity
event StrategyUpdated(uint256 strategyId, bool isActive, uint16 standardProtocolFeeBp, uint16 minTotalFeeBp)
```

It is emitted when an existing strategy is updated.

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| strategyId            | uint256 | Id of the strategy                                       |
| isActive              | bool    | Whether the strategy is active (or not) after the update |
| standardProtocolFeeBp | uint16  | Standard protocol fee (in basis point)                   |
| minTotalFeeBp         | uint16  | Minimum total fee (in basis point)                       |

## Errors

### NotV2Strategy

```solidity
error NotV2Strategy()
```

If the strategy has not set properly its implementation contract.

_It can only be returned for owner operations._

### StrategyHasNoSelector

```solidity
error StrategyHasNoSelector()
```

It is returned if the strategy has no selector.

_It can only be returned for owner operations._

### StrategyNotUsed

```solidity
error StrategyNotUsed()
```

It is returned if the strategyId is invalid.

### StrategyProtocolFeeTooHigh

```solidity
error StrategyProtocolFeeTooHigh()
```

It is returned if the strategy&#39;s protocol fee is too high.

_It can only be returned for owner operations._
